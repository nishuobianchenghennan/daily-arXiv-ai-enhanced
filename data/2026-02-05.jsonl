Here, we demonstrate a structurally driven, reversible topological phase transition in the distorted square net material GdPS, induced via in situ potassium dosing. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first principles calculations, we demonstrate a cascade of topological phases in the sub-surface P layer: from a large, topologically trivial band gap to a gapless Dirac cone state with a 2 eV dispersion, and finally to a two-dimensional topological insulator as inferred from theory. This evolution is driven by subtle structural distortions in the first P layer caused by potassium adsorption, which in turn contribute to the band gap closure and topological phase transition. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate the topology of a sub-surface layer in GdPS offers a unique route for exploring and controlling topological states in bulk materials."}

Review article", "summary": "The La2-xSrxCuO4+delta (LSCO) system provides a unique experimental setting for exploring how magnetism, superconductivity, and disorder jointly shape charge transport in a doped Mott insulator. Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates."}

It is known that for a constant collision coefficient $ν$, the solution to the Cauchy problem for such a system can lose smoothness.

However, the appearance of the dependence $ν(N)$ leads to a change in the type of the system, it loses hyperbolicity, which leads to computational problems. In this paper, we propose a new implicit solution method in Euler variables that overcomes these difficulties.

Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude."}

These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses)."}

The obtained results are considered in the framework of Faraday electromagnetic induction, which indicates that Landau quantization leads to the emergence of induced irradiation similar to Josephson and Andreev generation. Moreover, the detected maxima in the spectral characteristics correspond to odd fractional values of the resistance quantum staircases, while the dips in the electroluminescence spectra are observed at even fractional values of the resistance quantum ladder, which is due to the increased formation of composite bosons and fermions, respectively."}

Our approach leverages a stitching algorithm applied to a clipped Voronoi diagram generated from Lagrangian fluid particles, in order to maintain path connectivity around obstacles. This geometric discretization naturally conforms to arbitrarily thin structures, enabling boundary conditions to be enforced exactly at fluid-solid interfaces. By discretizing the pressure projection equations on this conforming mesh, we can enforce velocity boundary conditions at the interface for the fluid while applying pressure forces directly on the solid boundary, enabling sharp two-way coupling between phases. The resulting method prevents fluid leakage through solids while permitting flow wherever a continuous path exists through the fluid domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on diverse scenarios including flows around thin membranes, complex geometries with narrow passages, and deformable structures immersed in liquid, showcasing robust two-way coupling without artificial sealing or leakage artifacts."}

Such behavior has been attributed to substantial bond-dependent Kitaev interactions in combination with single-ion anisotropy, placing Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ among honeycomb compounds of interest for unconventional magnetic phases. Motivated by these observations, we present a first-principles-based analysis of the magnetic interactions in Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. By combining density-functional calculations with microscopic modeling, we extract the relevant exchange parameters and construct an effective spin model that quantitatively reproduces both the elastic neutron-scattering spectra and the magnetization curve. The model captures the experimentally observed zero-field zigzag magnetic order, and proposes a $\\textit{double-zigzag}$ state at intermediate magnetic fields, realizing the 1/3-magnetization plateau in a simpler way than suggested in previous works. Crucially, we show that the one-third magnetization plateau does not require Kitaev interactions; instead, it arises from the interplay of strong out-of-plane single-ion anisotropy and competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and antiferromagnetic third-neighbor ($J_3$) Heisenberg couplings. These results establish a consistent microscopic description of Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ and clarify the origin of its field-induced plateau phase."}

Using a topological framework grounded in Morse theory and singularity theory, we make use of the result that all smooth, even double well potentials reduce near the saddle point to a canonical quartic normal form. Within this regime, the interplay of noise, synaptic bias, and potential curvature produces a topologically robust short time evolution characterized by a tanh like response.

By characterizing resistive-switching behavior and oxygen vacancy motion using tailored electric pulse schemes, we decouple the resistive-switching behavior from the overall switching process in ultrathin ferroelectric HZO films, which would otherwise erroneously inflate polarization values and increase coercive fields.

Here, we perform atomistic simulations to determine local slip resistances (LSRs) of edge and screw dislocations on primary BCC slip planes in 12 equal-molar RMPEAs. Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR. The resulting framework accurately predicts tensile yield stress in BCC RMPEAs and provides guidance for alloy design."}

Review article", "summary": "The La2-xSrxCuO4+delta (LSCO) system provides a unique experimental setting for exploring how magnetism, superconductivity, and disorder jointly shape charge transport in a doped Mott insulator. Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates."}

Time-domain measurements reveal delayed and broadened terahertz waveforms with increasing Ru thickness, consistent with long-range orbital transport. In Co/Pt/Ru trilayers, the terahertz emission is further enhanced through constructive interference between the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in Pt and inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) in Ru, while reversed stack structures show suppressed output. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements reveal a strong correlation between damping and THz amplitude, highlighting efficient angular momentum conversion.

Molecular dynamics simulations and electrochemical analyses reveal a dual-ion cooperative mechanism that governs the reversibility: anions with the strongest binding affinity guide uniform Zn deposition by stabilizing the inner solvation shell, while formate anions co-enriched at the interface facilitate smooth stripping via protonation during the oxidation process. This orchestrated interplay effectively eliminates \"dead Zn\" accumulation and dendrite growth. Consequently, the device demonstrates a record-high lifespan of 15,000 cycles with negligible degradation and maintains a large optical modulation of >50%, along with multiple optical states (transparent, gray, black, and mirror). Furthermore, it achieves a large reflectance modulation (>50%) stable for over 2,000 cycles.

Van der Waals (vdW) nanomagnets, with their mechanical flexibility, are particularly promising for realizing large piezomagnetic responses and effective transport control.

Our analysis identifies 13 distinct symmetry classes for the tensor and reveals all potential material candidates. Considering the requirement of strong spin-orbit coupling for a large REE response, we screen the C2DB database and identify 54 promising 2D materials.

Our first principles calculations in the high-symmetry phase show that the Fermi surface is correctly reproduced only when the Hubbard interaction on the Te $5p$ orbitals is included, which in turn is essential for the appearance of a soft harmonic phonon mode at the CDW wavevector.

Magnetization induced by strain fields, such as in piezomagnetic and flexomagnetic effects, has typically been considered in materials that break time-reversal symmetry.

This mechanism differs from the conventional flexomagnetic effect: the strain gradient acts as a driving force on the electrons, generating magnetization in a manner closely analogous to current-induced magnetization. Treating the strain field as an external field, we derive a general expression for the magnetization induced by a strain gradient and demonstrate that this response is symmetry-allowed even in time-reversal symmetric systems. We apply our formulation to nonmagnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry, using a decorated square lattice, monolayer MoS$_2$, and monolayer Janus MoSSe as representative examples.

While a range of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have recently been observed in two-dimensional twisted moire systems, the theoretically anticipated filling factor v = -1/3 FQAH state has remained elusive, with debates centering on its nature of charge density wave or a topological Chern insulator. Here, we report the optical detection of a v = -1/3 FQAH state in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Using photoluminescence (PL) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) techniques, we identify ferromagnetic states at filling factors v = -1, -2/3, and -1/3, all tunable by a vertical electric field. The corresponding Curie temperatures are approximately 11 K, 3.5 K, and 2.4 K, respectively. The -1/3 state emerges over a narrower electric field range and a lower temperature compared to the integer and other fractional states, indicating its fragile nature that may lead to its absence in previous reports. Notably, the PL spectra at v = -1/3 disperse as the out-of-plane magnetic field increases, consistent with a nontrivial topological origin. Theoretical calculations based on the exact diagonalization method further support the interpretation of this topologically non-trivial state."}

ZnO is a promising semiconductor material due to its pyroelectric properties, stemming from non-centrosymmetric wurtzite crystal structure, enabling the pyro-phototronic effect that enhances response speed. Properties of ZnO can be tailored via alloying and doping. Thus, this work explores thin layers of ZnCdO:Eu random alloys grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on silicon substrates, with varying Cd content. The study shows that doping with Eu notably affects growth kinetics, promoting strong [0001] orientation preference. Moreover, photoluminescence measurements confirm the successful incorporation of Eu3+ ions into the structure. Electrical measurements show that the introduction of Cd eliminates the problem of Schottky barrier formation on the ZnO/Si interface. The n-ZnCdO:Eu/p-Si junctions exhibit rectifying behavior and generate photocurrent across 380-1150 nm wavelength range without external electrical bias. Utilizing the pyro-phototronic effect, these devices achieved ultrafast response times: rise time below 10 us and decay time below 5 us for 405 nm and 650 nm illumination - placing them among the fastest self-powered oxide-based detectors that do not rely on additional performance-enhancing layers."}

Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case.

Here, we perform atomistic simulations to determine local slip resistances (LSRs) of edge and screw dislocations on primary BCC slip planes in 12 equal-molar RMPEAs. Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR. The resulting framework accurately predicts tensile yield stress in BCC RMPEAs and provides guidance for alloy design."}

We find that the C sites directly bound to Ni undergo potential-driven hydrogenation, whereas hydrogenation at N sites is thermodynamically unfavorable. Taking NiNC3 as a representative system, we demonstrate that these hydrogenation processes proceed with accessible kinetic barriers and obey the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation. The resulting dynamic coordination reshapes the Ni 3d and dz2 orbitals, modulates the stability of the active center, and weakens molecular adsorption through combined electronic and steric effects.

Using sampling methods, we were able to construct the same junction structure as in the experiment within a computer model. We present a technique to calculate the Burgers vector of the triple junction. This allows us to connect the junction's dislocation character to the microscopic degrees of freedom of the joining grain boundaries. The junction line energy in the computer model can then be calculated using an embedded atom method potential. It follows the same laws as a bulk dislocation. Finally, we discovered a range of possible triple junctions for the observed grain boundaries, which vary in the magnitude of their Burgers vector. Interestingly, the experimentally observed junction is not the one with the smallest possible Burgers vector and energy. This suggests that the kinetics of transforming the junction line are likely too slow to be driven by the small energy contribution of the triple junction."}

Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $ΔM > 100Γ_i$, yields the universal upper bound $ε\\leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \\gtrsim 100~\\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T_{RH}\\simeq 10\\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis."}

While Fermi surface geometry has long been considered the primary driver of the instability, a full understanding of the lattice dynamics and electron-phonon role has remained elusive. Our first principles calculations in the high-symmetry phase show that the Fermi surface is correctly reproduced only when the Hubbard interaction on the Te $5p$ orbitals is included, which in turn is essential for the appearance of a soft harmonic phonon mode at the CDW wavevector. Analyzing the mode and momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling, we find that its variations with phonon momentum dominate over electronic effects. These results identify unambiguously the CDW origin in ZrTe$_3$ as a cooperative effect of Fermi surface geometry and momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling, with the latter playing the leading role. The mechanisms revealed in our work are directly relevant to other quasi-1D systems, including trichalcogenides and compounds hosting Peierls-like chains."}

In this work, we study supernova neutrino oscillations at DUNE using quantum entanglement as an organizing framework. Treating the three flavor neutrino system as an effective multipartite quantum state, we quantify flavor correlations through the entanglement of formation, concurrence, and negativity, expressed directly in terms of flavor survival and transition probabilities. Benchmark scenarios defined by representative variations of the electron neutrino survival probability are constructed for each entanglement measure. Event rates and fluences are computed for a supernova at 10 kpc, and the mass ordering sensitivity is evaluated using detector-level simulations performed with the \\texttt{SNOwGLoBES} framework, employing the Garching supernova flux model and including the dominant detection channels in liquid argon: $ν_e$ and $\\barν_e$ charged-current interactions on argon and elastic scattering on electrons. We analyze both individual and combined detection channels and incorporate $5\\%$ normalization and energy calibration systematic uncertainties. Our results show that DUNE achieves a $5σ$ determination of the neutrino mass ordering for a supernova at distances of $\\sim 20$~kpc for the $ν_e$ charged current channel and $\\sim 2$~kpc for the $\\barν_e$ channel, with the reach depending on the entanglement scenario considered. These results demonstrate that entanglement based observables provide a complementary and robust framework for probing supernova neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass ordering."}

Here, we realize a bifurcation-induced nonreciprocal lattice that supports robust propagation of elastic kink waves. Each unit is a prestrained, hinged-beam circulator that develops angular momentum bias during snap-through transitions between buckling states, producing an effective breaking of time reversal symmetry. Coupling such units into a hexagonal array yields a mechanically chiral network where localized soliton-like excitations propagate unidirectionally along interfaces and edges, immune to sharp bends. We demonstrate non-dispersive kink transport governed by a SineGordon type field whose effective bias encodes mechanical chirality. This framework bridges bifurcation dynamics and nonreciprocal transport, establishing a nonlinear route toward topological like mechanical functionality without magnetic or gyroscopic bias."}

However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande."}

Natural language processing approaches, particularly large language models (LLMs), have been explored for materials data extraction from the literature, yet often suffer from limited accuracy or narrow scope. In this work, an LLM-based pipeline is developed to accurately extract alloy-related information from both textual descriptions and tabular data across the literature on high-entropy (or multicomponent) alloys (HEA). Specifically two databases with 37,711 and 148,069 entries respectively are retrieved; one from the literature text, consisting of alloy composition, processing conditions, characterization methods, and reported properties, and other from the literature tables, consisting of property names, values, and units. The pipeline enhances materials-domain sensitivity through prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation and achieves F1-scores of 0.83 for textual extraction and 0.88 for tabular extraction, surpassing or matching existing approaches. Application of the pipeline to over 10,000 articles yields the largest publicly available multicomponent alloy database and reveals compositional and processing-property trends. The database is further employed for sustainability-aware materials selection in three application domains, i.e., lightweighting, soft magnetic, and corrosion-resistant, identifying multicomponent alloy candidates with more sustainable production while maintaining or exceeding benchmark performance. The pipeline developed can be easily generalized to other class of materials, and assist in development of comprehensive, accurate and usable databases for sustainable materials design."}

Using zeolite-based SWCNTs prepared by alcohol CVD, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, together with two-dimensional excitation-emission fitting was employed to quantify chirality-specific growth efficiency. Two distinct growth regimes were identified. At a relatively low temperature of 600 C, pure Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity, promoting efficient growth of small-diameter (0.7-0.9 nm) SWCNTs. In contrast, at 850 C, the Fe0.75Co0.25 alloy shows a pronounced enhancement in growth efficiency compared with pure Fe, pure Co, and other Fe-Co compositions, also yielding larger diameter tubes (0.9-1.1nm). Similar growth behavior was observed on SiO2 substrates, enabling detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of catalyst nanoparticles. Electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that high SWCNT yields correlate with the formation of small, uniform Fe-Co nanoparticles with Co-enriched surfaces, in excellent agreement with MD simulations. Lastly, MD results are summarized in a composition-diameter phase diagram that rationalizes the experimentally observed growth trends. The exceptional performance of the Fe0.75Co0.25 catalyst at high temperature is attributed to the stabilization of small and uniform catalyst clusters, providing mechanistic insight into the synergistic roles of alloy composition and temperature in SWCNT growth."}

However, conventional surface irradiation often produces shallow, nonuniform damage, obscuring interfacial behavior. In this study, we perform cross-sectional He irradiation to directly examine the interfacial response and He bubble evolution across Cr monolayer and Cr and CrAlSiN multilayer coatings on Zr substrates. Irradiation was carried out at 500 C and 750 C to doses of 2 and 3 dpa, enabling a direct comparison of temperature-dependent microstructural evolution. In the Cr monolayer, He implantation produced a homogeneous distribution of nanoscale bubbles throughout the damaged region and large cavities at the Cr and Zr interface, indicating severe Kirkendall-type voiding and interfacial decohesion at elevated temperature. In contrast, the Cr/CrAlSiN multilayer exhibited a periodically modulated bubble distribution, with bubble fragmentation and transformation into nanoscale platelets at CrAlSiN interfaces. A N-enriched Zr(N) interlayer formed spontaneously at the CrAlSiN and Zr interface, effectively suppressing bubble accumulation and interdiffusion. The nanochannel interfaces acted as He sinks and diffusion barriers, enhancing interfacial bonding and mitigating swelling. This work demonstrates that cross-sectional ion irradiation is a powerful approach for probing interfacial stability in multilayer systems, offering new insights into He-defect interactions and radiation tolerance engineering at buried interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of Cr and CrAlSiN multilayers as advanced coating architectures for high-temperature nuclear environments."}

In this work, we introduce an alternative strategy for learning tensorial quantities based on scalar descriptors. We apply this approach to the Born effective charge tensor, showing that scalar (monopole) kernel models can successfully capture its tensorial nature by exploiting the definition of the Born effective charge tensor as the derivative of the polarisation with respect to atomic displacements. We compare this method with tensorial (dipole) kernel models, as established in our previous work, in which the tensorial structure of the Born effective charge is encoded directly in the kernel and obtained via its derivative. Both approaches are then used for charge partitioning, enabling the separation of monopole and dipole contributions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by computing finite-temperature infrared spectra for a range of complex materials."}

Here, we perform atomistic simulations to determine local slip resistances (LSRs) of edge and screw dislocations on primary BCC slip planes in 12 equal-molar RMPEAs. Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR. The resulting framework accurately predicts tensile yield stress in BCC RMPEAs and provides guidance for alloy design."}

We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics."}
