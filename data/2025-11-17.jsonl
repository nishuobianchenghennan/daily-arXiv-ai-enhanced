The presence of vacuum-like jets, jets that experienced little interaction with the Quark Gluon Plasma, in the nucleus-nucleus samples dilutes the overall observed modification hindering the detailed study of the underlying physical mechanisms. The ability to ascertain on a jet-by-jet basis the degree of modification of a jet would be an invaluable step in overcoming this limitation. We consider a Transformer classifier, trained on a low-level representation of jets given by the 4-momenta of all its constituents. We show that the Transformer is able to capture discriminating information not accessible to other architectures which use high-level physical observables as input. The Transformer allows us to identify, in the experimentally relevant case where both medium response and underlying event contamination are accounted for, a class of jets that have been unequivocally modified. Further, we perform a robust estimate of the upper bound for the fraction of jets in nucleus-nucleus collisions that are, for all purposes, indistinguishable from those produced in proton-proton collisions."}

Whilst traditional algorithms like LZMA and ZLIB are widely used, they often fail to exploit the deep structure inherent in scientific data. We investigate the application of modern state space models (SSMs) to this problem, which have shown promise for capturing long-range dependencies in sequences. We present the Bytewise Online Autoregressive (BOA) Constrictor, a novel, streaming-capable lossless compressor built upon the Mamba architecture. BOA combines an autoregressive Mamba model for next-byte prediction with a parallelised streaming range coder. We evaluate our method on three distinct structured datasets in HEP, demonstrating state-of-the-art compression ratios, improving upon LZMA-9 across all datasets. These improvements range from 2.21$\\times$ (vs. 1.69$\\times$) on the ATLAS dataset to a substantial 44.14$\\times$ (vs. 27.14$\\times$) on the highly-structured CMS dataset, with a modest $\\sim 4.5$MB model size. However, this gain in compression ratio comes with a trade-off in throughput; the Storage-Saving Rate ($σ_{SSR}$) of our prototype currently lags behind highly-optimised CPU-based algorithms like ZLIB. We conclude that while this Mamba-based approach is a highly promising proof-of-principle, significant future work on performance optimisation and hardware portability is required to develop it into a production-ready tool for the HEP community."}

However, real-world synthesis and functionalization processes introduce structural modifications that can compromise its mechanical integrity. Nitrogen doping, while beneficial for electronic property tuning, often results in atomic clustering rather than uniform distribution, while concurrent vacancy defect formation represents another common structural alteration during processing. This study systematically investigates the comparative effects of nitrogen atom clusters and equivalent sized vacancy defects on the mechanical behavior of graphene sheets through molecular dynamics simulations. The Nitrogen clustering significantly degraded mechanical performance almost similarly to random doping. In comparison, systems with equivalent-sized vacancy defects showed higher stiffness and lower ductility than those with clusters. The study revealed distinct failure mechanisms between doped and defective configurations, with nitrogen clusters showing modified crack propagation patterns while vacancies acted as pronounced stress concentrators, leading to premature failure. However, this study also showed that defect morphology critically influences mechanical properties. These findings provide important insights for optimizing graphene synthesis and processing protocols, highlighting the differential mechanical risks associated with dopant clustering versus vacancy formation. The results inform defect-tolerant design strategies for graphene-based nanoelectronics, composites, and sensors, where mechanical reliability is paramount for device performance and longevity."}

Near the charge neutrality point, disorder may drive a metal-insulator transition, and enhance the longitudinal conductivity. For the massless case, the minimal conductivity $σ_{xx}^*$ coexists with the half-quantized Hall conductivity $e^2/2h$, forming an indicator for the parity anomalous semimetal.

One promising remedy is to utilize the time-dependent 2-reduced density matrix (2-RDM) that directly represents two-body observables in an N-particle system, and resort to the extended TDDFT for multibody densities to break the confines of spatial local on one-body density [Phys. Rev. Lett. 26(6) (2024) 263001]. However, the usage of 2-RDM is prohibitive due to the augmented dimensionality, e.g., 4-D space for unidimensional 2-RDM. This work addresses the high-dimensional numerical challenges by using an equivalent Wigner phase-space formulation of 2-RDM and seeking efficient spectral approximations to nonlocal quantum potentials. For spatial periodic case, a pseudo-difference operator approach is derived for both the Hartree-exchange-correlation term and two-body collision operator, while the discretization via the Chebyshev spectral element method is provided for non-periodic case. A massively parallel numerical scheme, which integrates these spectral approximations with a distributed characteristics method, allows us to make the first attempt for real simulations of 2-RDM dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the two-body correction to the quantum kinetic theory, and show the increase in the system's entropy induced by the two-bdoy interaction. Thus it may pave the way for an accurate description of 2-RDM dynamics and advance to a practical application of many-body TDDFT."}

However, the adsorption of nonpolar gases, particularly noble gases, poses a considerable challenge under atmospheric pressure and room temperature (RT). Here, we theoretically simulate and experimentally realize the stable adsorption of noble gases like xenon (Xe), krypton (Kr), argon (Ar), and helium (He) on highly rippled graphene at RT. The elemental characteristics of adsorbed Xe are confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The adsorbed gas atoms are crystalized with periodic arrangements. These adsorbed noble gases on graphene exhibit high stability at RT and can be completely desorbed at approximately 350 °C without damaging the intrinsic lattice of graphene. The structural and physical properties of graphene are significantly influenced by the adsorbed gas, and they fully recover after desorption. Additionally, this controllable adsorption could be generalized to other layered adsorbents such as NbSe2, MoS2 and carbon nanotubes. We anticipate that this ripple-assisted adsorption will not only re-define the theoretical framework of gas adsorption, but also accelerate advancements in gas storage and separation technologies, as well as enhance the applications in catalysis, surface modification, and other related fields."}

We also find that several other response functions vanish in parity-symmetric materials, making these systems as simple as isotropic detectors in some respects. Finally, we present the scattering rate for an anisotropic, possibly chiral detector, for generic dark matter-electron spin interactions. These relations reduce the number of independent response functions needed, thereby simplifying the computational complexity for a broad class of dark matter models. Our results provide a complete and efficient toolkit for analyzing electron recoil signals in diverse detector materials."}

The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states."}

Temperature-dependent neutron powder diffraction confirms the rhombohedral R-3c structure down to 5 K without any structural phase transition. DC magnetization, ac susceptibility, and relaxation measurements reveal a gradual evolution from a high-temperature paramagnetic-like state to a partially disordered antiferromagnetic (PDA) state below 100 K, accompanied by slow cluster-like spin dynamics followed by a freezing transition near 30 K. Isothermal magnetic hysteresis M(H) loops demonstrate partial chain freezing, while robust exchange bias is observed in field-cooled protocols, highlighting the interplay between PDA ordering and frozen spins. Resistivity and specific heat data indicate strong coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, accompanied by activated transport behavior. Raman spectroscopy identifies pronounced anomalies in phonon frequencies and linewidths across multiple magnetic regimes, reflecting strong spin-lattice coupling. Polarization-electric field (P-E) measurements reveal temperature-dependent crossovers from linear dielectric to weakly hysteretic behavior, consistent with short-range polar correlations driven by spin-lattice interactions.

To accelerate discovery under moderate pressures, an interpretable framework based on symbolic regression is developed to predict Tc in hydrogen-based superconductors. A key descriptor is an integrated density of states (IDOS) within 1 eV of the Fermi level (EF), which exhibits greater robustness than conventional single-point DOS features. The resulting analytic model links electronic-structure characteristics to superconducting performance, achieves high accuracy (RMSEtrain = 20.15 K), and generalizes well to external datasets. By relying solely on electronic structure calculations, the approach greatly accelerates materials screening. Guided by this model, four hydrogen-based candidates are identified and validated via calculation: Na2GaCuH6 with Tc =42.04 K at ambient pressure (exceeding MgB2), and NaCaH12, NaSrH12, and KSrH12 with Tc up to 162.35 K, 86.32 K, and 55.13 K at 100 GPa, 25 GPa, and 25 GPa, respectively.

The spectrum is obtained with a two stage Monte Carlo approach. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) provides optimized radial trial states with the desired nodal pattern.

This localization invalidates the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating an analysis under open boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit. The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szegö limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szegö limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear. In this paper, we establish the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework, providing a unified and rigorous foundation for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems. By combining the WHF with Hermitian doubling, we first elucidate the applicability criteria for the generalized Szegö limit theorem in multiband systems. We then show that the WHF provides the natural mathematical origin for the symmetry-decomposed Ronkin function in symmetry class AII$^\\dagger$, leading to a rigorous proof of the generalized Szegö limit theorem for these systems and opening a path toward systematic generalizations to other symmetry classes."}

All transition-metal moments saturate below 1 T, while the rare-earth moments do not saturate even at 5 T, consistent with van Vleck paramagnetic contributions and crystal field suppression. While the sum rules are widely used to extract element-specific magnetic moments from XMCD, we show that for 3d transition metals, their application requires accurate estimates of the number of unoccupied 3d states. We observe a finite magnetic moment on Ni, challenging the common assumption of its nonmagnetic character in Laves phases. The orbital magnetic moments were determined using the spin rules, while the spin moments were estimated from single-ion values from multiplet calculations, due to the invalidity of the spin sum rule for light rare-earth elements. The magnetic moments of Nd and Pr are found to be suppressed relative to their free-ion values, with multiplet theory indicating that this is due to crystal field effects. Our results confirm that Nd and Pr maintain localized 4f3 and 4f2 configurations, respectively, and that their element-specific magnetic moments are robust to rare-earth substitution. Ce, on the other hand, exhibits a tunable mixed-valent ground state with both magnetic 4f1 and nonmagnetic 4f0 components. The relative fraction of these states varies with the electronegativity of the surrounding 3d transition metals, revealing a pathway to tune Ce magnetism via composition. This work establishes a framework for accurately interpreting XMCD in light rare-earth-based intermetallics."}

The mixing schemes for the isoscalar light mesons are considered. The possible assignment of the experimentally observed excited light mesons to the particular states is discussed. The form factors parameterizing weak decay matrix elements between the initial $B$ meson and final light mesons are calculated with the complete account of the relativistic effects, including contributions of the intermediate negative energy states and relativistic transformations of the meson wave functions from rest to the moving reference frame. As a result the transferred momentum squared, $q^2$, dependence of the form factors is explicitly determined in the whole accessible kinematical range. On the basis of the helicity formalism the decay branching fractions and asymmetry and polarization parameters are calculated. The obtained results for the semileptonic $B$ decays to the ground states of light mesons are confronted with available experimental data. On this basis the value of the $|V_{ub}|$ matrix element is determined. It is found in good agreement with the value extracted from inclusive decays. Predictions for the branching fractions of the semileptonic $B$ decays to radially ($2S$ and $3S$) and orbitally ($1P$ and $2P$) excited light mesons are given. Comparison with the previous calculations is performed. It is found that several decays to the excited light mesons have branching fractions of the order $10^{-4}$ and, thus, they can be measured at existing and future $B$ factories."}

However, reliably nucleating these 3D textures has proven challenging, and so far, 3D configurations such as vortex rings and hopfions can often only be observed forming spontaneously in relatively uncontrolled manners. Here, we demonstrate that through the 3D nanopatterning of chiral single crystal helimagnets into nano-tori, the controlled formation of a magnetic double helix can be achieved. This surface-localized topological state is stabilized by the interplay of intrinsic exchange interactions of the single crystal with the extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry. These double helices host magnetic defects akin to supercoiling in circular DNA and climbing vines. We expect this study to serve as a foundation for future research combining single crystal systems with 3D nanopatterning, offering a new degree of control over emergent phenomena in nanoscale magnets and wider quantum material systems."}

Here, first-principles calculations are used to contrast the thermal transport in covalent zincblende (zb) and metavalent rocksalt (rs) BeO. We find that the metavalent bonding in rs-BeO enhances lattice anharmonicity, activating multi-phonon scattering channels and suppressing phonon transport. This results in an ultralow $κ_L$ of 24 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300 K, starkly contrasting with the zb phase (357 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$). Accurately modeling such strongly anharmonic systems requires explicit inclusion of temperature-dependent phonon renormalization and four-phonon scattering. These contributions, negligible in zb-BeO, are essential for high-precision calculations of the severely suppressed $κ_L$ in rs-BeO. Finally, we identify three key indicators to guide the discovery of metavalently bonded, incipient-metallic materials: (i) an NaCl-type crystal structure, (ii) large Grüneisen parameters ($\\textgreater$2), and (iii) a breakdown of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation.

We find that buried conduction and valence topological surface states of PdTe2 lead to resonant enhancement of optical second-harmonic generation.

In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a \"dark photosphere\" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space.

At finite density, it yields a crossover-to-first-order transition and predicts a critical endpoint at $T_C = 75.4~\\text{MeV}$ and $μ_C = 768~\\text{MeV}$, within the reach of heavy-ion experiments. These findings establish a unified holographic framework for the QCD phase structure across quark masses and baryon density, providing the first consistent and quantitative description of both deconfinement and chiral transitions within a single holographic model."}

To address this, we develop and deploy a human-AI collaborative (HAIC) workflow that integrates large language models for hypothesis generation and analysis, with collaborative policy updates driving autonomous pulsed laser deposition (PLD) experiments for remote epitaxy of BaTiO$_3$/graphene. HAIC accelerated the hypothesis formation and experimental design and efficiently mapped the growth space to graphene-damage. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that chemistry drives degradation while the highest energy plume components seed defects, identifying a low-O$_2$ pressure low-temperature synthesis window that preserves graphene but is incompatible with optimal BaTiO$_3$ growth. Thus, we show a two-step Ar/O$_2$ deposition is required to exfoliate ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ while maintaining a monolayer graphene interlayer. HAIC stages human insight with AI reasoning between autonomous batches to drive rapid scientific progress, providing an evolution to many existing human-in-the-loop autonomous workflows."}

To address the demand for such large datasets, we introduce RF-Squad, a physics-based simulator designed to realistically replicate radiofrequency (RF) reflectometry measurements of quantum dot arrays, with the ability to go beyond the Constant Interaction Model (CIM) and simulate physical phenomena such as tunnel coupling, tunnel rates, and quantum confinement.

Electrical transport has been the primary diagnostic tool for identifying superconductivity in these systems, whereas complementary probes, including magnetic, spectroscopic, tunnelling and ultrafast methods, remain mostly qualitative due to experimental constraints and sample heterogeneity. Recent concerns over their reliability have fuelled controversy, leading to scepticism and pointing out the need for alternative, quantitative approaches. In this study, we acquired unprecedented high-quality Raman spectra of hexagonal LaH10 at approximately 145 GPa and low temperatures, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements. Upon cooling, we observe a drop of resistivity and simultaneous remarkable variations of phonon frequencies and linewidths. These effects are interpreted and perfectly reproduced by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, providing a definitive proof of phonon-mediated superconductivity and enabling a quantitative determination of the superconducting energy gap.

A generic prediction of the framework is the presence of a further light scalar state, the dilaton, which naturally couples weakly to the Higgs boson. The implementation of the framework usually requires the presence of a third, heavier state, which plays the role of dark matter and ensures the couplings run so that the multi-phase criticality condition is met. In this paper we consider the multi-phase criticality limit of an extension of the Standard Model including two extra scalar singlets, addressing the scenario with effective field theory methods that are particularly suited for treating the hierarchical mass spectrum that this construction yields. The analysis improves on the approximated results available in the Literature and explores the phenomenology of the model at collider and dark matter experiments. We find that the running of scalar couplings in the EFT between the two scales cannot be ignored, but the quantum corrections from the dark matter candidate are not noticeably modified."}

Our analysis reveals that the presence of primordial black holes can reduce the effective action and might modify the nucleation rate due to their gravitational effects, potentially altering the dynamics of the phase transition in the early universe and producing new gravitational wave signals since the gravitational effects of the primordial black hole or other possible inhomogeneous sources could lead to nucleation of non-spherical symmetric bubbles."}
