Thermal creep, being\nstress-sensitive, contributes to early-stage stress relaxation and strain\naccumulation, leading to higher strain compared to the irradiation-only case.\nThe interaction of thermal creep with irradiation mechanisms modifies the\nstress distribution and clearance evolution, with relaxation governed by\nprismatic slip.

One problem with using twist to generate moir\\'e interference has\nbeen the difficulty in creating high-quality, uniform, and repeatable samples\ndue to fabrication through mechanical stacking with viscoelastic stamps. Here\nwe show, a new method to generate moir\\'e interference through the controlled\napplication of layer-by-layer strain (heterostrain) on non-twisted 2D\nmaterials, where moir\\'e interference results from strain-induced lattice\nmismatch without twisting or stacking. Heterostrain generation is achieved by\ndepositing stressed thin films onto 2D materials to apply large strains to the\ntop layers while leaving layers further down less strained. We achieve\ndeterministic control of moir\\'e periodicity and symmetry in non-twisted 2D\nmultilayers and bilayers, with 97% yield, through varying stressor film force\n(film thickness X film stress) and geometry. Moir\\'e reconstruction effects are\nmemorized after the removal of the stressor layers. Control over the strain\ndegree-of-freedom opens the door to a completely unexplored set of unrealized\ntunable moir\\'e geometric symmetries, which may now be achieved in a high-yield\nand user-skill independent process taking only hours. This technique solves a\nlong-standing throughput bottleneck in new moir\\'e quantum materials discovery\nand opens the door to industrially-compatible manufacturing for 2D\nmoir\\'e-based electronic or optical devices."}

Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$\nremains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of\nmagnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic\nscattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on\nthe (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states.\nLeveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally\nforbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of\ncolinear antiferromagnetic order.
