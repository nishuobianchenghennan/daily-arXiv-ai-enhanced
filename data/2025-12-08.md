### [1] [Mechanical Stability of 2D Ti2COx MXenes Under Compression Using Reactive Molecular Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05166)
*Hossein Darban*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 本文通过分子动力学模拟研究了Ti2C和Ti2CO2 MXene纳米片的压缩和屈曲行为，发现表面官能团（氧）和侧向约束能显著提高其屈曲强度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典连续介质力学在预测MXene纳米片的屈曲应变方面存在显著高估，因此需要通过原子尺度的模拟来更准确地理解其在压缩负载下的力学行为和失效机制，这对于其在复合材料等领域的应用至关重要。

Method: 研究采用大规模反应分子动力学模拟方法，对Ti2C和Ti2CO2 MXene纳米片施加单轴、双轴和剪切载荷，以研究其屈曲模式、原子级变形机制和失效特征。

Result: 结果表明：1) 纳米片沿扶手椅（armchair）方向比沿锯齿形（zigzag）方向具有更高的抗屈曲能力。2) 氧表面官能团可将屈曲应力从约1 GPa提高到3.5 GPa，并降低方向各向异性。3) 侧向约束压力能大幅增加屈曲应力。4) 在大应变下，Ti2CO2会发生断裂，而Ti2C能保持结构完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了MXene纳米片在不同负载下的复杂屈曲行为和机理，证明了表面化学（氧官能团）和外部约束对其力学性能的关键影响。这些发现为未来设计和开发基于MXene形态转换的新型结构（如纳米管、纳米卷）提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The compressive and post-buckling behavior of Ti2C and Ti2CO2 MXene nanosheets is studied using large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Nanosheets are subjected to uniaxial, biaxial, and shear loads to investigate their buckling modes, atomic-level deformation mechanisms, and failure characteristics. The results indicate that classical continuum mechanics significantly overestimates the buckling strains. Nanosheets exhibit higher resistance to buckling along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction. Although atomic-scale defects reduce the buckling stress, they influence deformation only locally and do not alter the global buckling mode shapes. Lateral confinement pressure, such as that caused by polymerization-induced shrinkage in MXene-polymer composites, substantially increases the buckling stress. Oxygen surface termination increases the buckling stress from approximately 1 GPa to 3.5 GPa and reduces directional anisotropy in the elastic response. Under large compressive strains, Ti2CO2 nanosheets fracture, whereas Ti2C nanosheets retain structural integrity at strains exceeding 0.35. Atomistic analysis reveals opposite stress states in the top and bottom Ti layers due to curvature-induced strain gradients. Under biaxial compression, the nanosheet buckles in a dome-like shape, whereas shear loads produce elliptical deflection modes. The presented findings stimulate future studies on MXene morphological transformations, such as the development of nanotube, nanoscroll, and folded architectures.

TL;DR: 本文通过基准测试发现，通用的机器学习模型（uMLIPs）可直接用于模拟负载型纳米催化剂，在探索未知稳定结构方面表现出潜力，但其计算效率远低于为特定体系开发的专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用密度泛函理论（DFT）来模拟负载型纳米颗粒催化剂的计算成本极高，限制了模拟的尺寸和时间尺度。虽然机器学习原子间势（MLIPs）可以解决此问题，但训练过程本身也十分昂贵。因此，本文旨在评估那些在大规模数据集上预训练的“通用”MLIPs，是否能直接且有效地应用于特定催化剂体系，从而省去模型训练的成本。

Method: 研究人员将两种通用的机器学习原子间势（MACE-OMAT 和 MatterSim）与一个专门为铜/氧化铝（Cu/Al₂O₃）体系训练的领域特定模型（DP-UniAlCu）进行了基准比较。他们通过全局结构优化和分子动力学（MD）模拟，评估这些模型在预测负载型铜纳米颗粒能量、结构和动态行为方面的准确性和计算效率。

Result: 1.  **结构搜索**: MACE-OMAT能较好地复现低能构型；MatterSim虽能量偏差较大，但出人意料地发现了一些比其他模型更稳定的构型，展现了其强大的结构搜索能力。
2.  **动态模拟**: 两款通用模型都能定性地复现领域特定模型预测的铜原子均方根位移（MSD），但其计算成本要高出约两个数量级。

Conclusion: 通用机器学习原子间势（uMLIPs）无需额外训练或微调，便可直接用于模拟负载型纳米颗粒体系，尤其在结构探索方面很有潜力。然而，其计算效率显著低于领域特定模型，这是限制其进行大规模模拟的主要因素。

Abstract: Supported nanoparticle catalysts are widely used in the chemical industry. Computational modeling of supported nanoparticles based on density functional theory (DFT) often involves structural searches of stable local minimum energy configurations and molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperature. These are computationally demanding tasks that are intractable within DFT for large systems. In the last two decades, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have been successfully used to substantially increase the size and time scales accessible to simulations that retain DFT accuracy. However, training reliable MLIPs is non-trivial as it requires many costly DFT calculations. Recently, several universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) have been developed, which are trained on large datasets that cover a wide range of molecules and materials. Here, we benchmark the accuracy and the efficiency of these uMLIPs in describing Cu nanoparticles supported on Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces against our domain-specific DP-UniAlCu model. We find that the MACE-OMAT can reproduce reasonably well the low-energy configurations found in global optimization at an energy accuracy comparable to DP-UniAlCu. Interestingly, the MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M model, which exhibits larger deviations in the binding energies, can find even more stable configurations than the other two models in some supported nanoparticle sizes, showing its capability in structure exploration. For MD simulations, MACE-OMAT and MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M can qualitatively reproduce the mean-squared displacements of Cu atoms (MSD$_\mathrm{Cu}$) predicted by DP-UniAlCu, albeit at roughly two orders of magnitude higher cost. We demonstrate that the uMLIPs can be very useful in simulating supported nanoparticles even without any fine-tuning, though their reduced efficiency remains a limiting factor for large-scale simulations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种创新的实验方法，首次实现了对材料中缺陷（如空位和纳米空洞）周围化学键电子分布的直接测量。研究结果不仅精确测量了空位体积，还发现了材料缺陷的“愈合”现象，为理解材料的微观属性提供了新工具。

Motivation: 所有材料都存在会破坏化学键的缺陷和纳米结构，但此前一直缺乏能够直接测量这些区域化学键电子分布的实验方法。本研究的动机就是为了攻克这一难题，直接观察缺陷处的电子结构。

Method: 作者提出了一种具有深度分辨和空位敏感特性的实验方法，能够直接测量与缺陷和纳米结构相关的化学键电子分布。他们将此方法应用于研究铝中的纳米空洞及周围的空位。

Result: 1. 首次在实验上以3%的不确定性精确测量了单个空位的体积。
2. 实现了纳米空洞周围空位浓度的三维纳米级分辨率成像。
3. 发现了辐射损伤形成的空洞可以“愈合”的现象。
4. 实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算结果吻合。

Conclusion: 这项工作为测量非均匀、纳米结构、多相材料中的化学键电子密度开辟了新途径，有助于从电子层面揭示材料中强化、弱化、界面功能、溶质扩散和相变等现象的起源。

Abstract: All materials have defects and many contain nanostructures, both of which disrupt chemical bonding - the basis of materials properties. No experimental measurements of bonding electron distributions associated with defects and nanostructures have ever been possible. We present a method enabling such measurements and interrogate nanovoids surrounded by vacancies - the most fundamental of nanostructures and defects - in aluminium. We measure the volume of a vacancy with 3% uncertainty and map vacancy concentrations surrounding nanovoids with nanometre resolution in three dimensions where previously only two-dimensional mapping was possible. We discover that radiation-damaged voids can "heal". Our bonding measurements are depth-resolved, vacancy-sensitive, and agree with density functional theory. This work opens bonding electron density measurements to inhomogeneous nanostructured multi-phased materials so that the electronic origins of phenomena such as strengthening, weakening, interface functionality, solute diffusion and phase transformations within them may be revealed.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of the vibration density of states (VDOS) of a silica nanopore, systematically evaluating a range of force fields against inelastic neutron scattering results. We analyze the influence of temperature, crustal structure, and surface-adsorbed water molecules on the nanopore's structural and dynamic properties. We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations of nanopore and bulk silica, and used density functional theory (DFT) calculations for bulk silica for comparison. The resulting VDOS shows relatively good agreement with DFT and experimental data. The temperature has a relatively low effect on the dry nanopore. The inclusion of H2O molecules significantly affects the VDOS. The low-energy modes are dominated by H2O VDOS and increase with loading. This work is an essential step towards characterizing silica nanopores via molecular dynamics and provides a valuable reference for experimental comparison with X-ray and neutron scattering VDOS results.

Abstract: Foundation machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are trained on overlapping chemical spaces, yet their latent representations remain model-specific. Here, we show that independently developed MLIPs exhibit statistically consistent geometric organisation of atomic environments, which we term the Platonic representation. By projecting embeddings relative to a set of atomic anchors, we unify the latent spaces of seven MLIPs (spanning equivariant, non-equivariant, conservative, and non-conservative architectures) into a common metric space that preserves chemical periodicity and structural invariants. This unified framework enables direct cross-model optimal transport, interpretable embedding arithmetic, and the detection of representational biases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that geometric distortions in this space can indicate physical prediction failures, including symmetry breaking and incorrect phonon dispersions. Our results show that the latent spaces of diverse MLIPs present consistent statistical geometry shaped by shared physical and chemical constraints, suggesting that the Platonic representation offers a practical route toward interoperable, comparable, and interpretable foundation models for materials science.

Abstract: Altermagnets and fully-compensated ferrimagnets are two canonical classes of zero-net-moment magnets. An altermagnetic (AM) half-metal cannot exist due to its AM spin splitting, while a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic (FC-FIM) metal seems impossible to realize because both spin channels remain gapless. Here, we propose that an FC-FIM metal can be realized by breaking the rotational or mirror symmetry that links two spin-opposite magnetic atoms in an AM metal. We further demonstrate that charge-carrier doping is fundamentally unable to generate a net magnetic moment in an altermagnet, whereas such a net moment can be readily induced in a fully-compensated ferrimagnet. We use the AM monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2O}$ as a concrete example to validate our proposal. Either electric field or uniaxial strain can break the $S_{4z}$ symmetry of $\mathrm{Cr_2O}$, thereby inducing a transition from an AM metal to an FC-FIM metal. Uniaxial strain plus carrier doping creates a net moment in an altermagnet, and the so-called piezomagnetism is essentially a strain-driven switch from altermagnetism to fully-compensated ferrimagnetism. By analogy, we advance the concept of electromagnetism: an electric field drives the transition from altermagnetism to fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, and subsequent charge-carrier doping stabilizes a net magnetization. Our work provides a roadmap for further exploring the connection and distinction between altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet, and confirms the feasibility of FC-FIM metal.

Abstract: The dynamic reconstruction of surfaces during electrochemical reactions plays a crucial role in determining the performance of electrocatalysts. However, because reconstructions occur at the atomic level, direct observation and elucidation of the underlying mechanism are challenging for conventional powder type catalysts with ill defined lattices. In this study, the catalytically active surface of 3C BaRuO3 (BRO) epitaxial thin films emerges upon the dynamic introduction of surface Ru clusters, for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the mass activity at overpotential 100 mV, the intrinsic HER performance increases dramatically from 0.11 to 7.72 A/mg immediately after the initial HER cycle and eventually saturates at 1.05 A/mg after continuous operation. The formation of Ru clusters on the catalyst surface, driven by selective Ba leaching under alkaline HER conditions, is observed experimentally. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that HER activity increased with enhanced H* adsorption owing to the dynamic Ru6 cluster formation. A strategy for stabilizing the 'awakened' active surface of BRO is further proposed by validating that the atomic-scale control of the film thickness can effectively maintain the highly active state. This study offers fundamental insights into the design and stabilization of the highly active Ru-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline HER.

Abstract: A15 superconductors are distinguished by their high critical temperatures, magnetic fields, and current-carrying capabilities. Among them, Nb$_3$Al is of particular interest for superconducting quantum circuits as a means to extend device operating temperatures, provided that its electrodynamic properties are well understood. Here, we report on the synthesis of Nb$_3$Al thin films by magnetron co-sputtering followed by rapid thermal processing, yielding superconducting transition temperatures above 16~K. Microwire devices patterned from these films exhibit a coherence length of $3.2\,\mathrm{nm}$ and superfluid densities as low as $1.1\times 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, suggesting that Nb$_3$Al may enable high kinetic inductance in thinner films. Coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on Nb$_3$Al demonstrate single-photon internal quality factors up to $2.26\times 10^{5}$. These results establish Nb$_3$Al as a promising material platform for the development of superconducting quantum circuits operating at elevated temperatures, contingent on appropriate control of interfacial chemistry and surface morphology.

Abstract: Integrating magnetic order to moiré superlattices is of significant scientific and technological interest. Based on first-principles calculations, we study the interplay of magnetic proximity and moiré proximity in WSe2/WSe2/CrI3 trilayers with different stackings and twist angles. Large valley splitting is observed due to redistribution of the exciton charge density across layers via a super-exchange-like mechanism, and its electric-field dependence bears similarity to electrically tunable and valley-selective Feshbach resonances. The valley splitting can be magnified in moiré superlattices owing to the superposition of Umklapp excitons folded from moiré minibands, yielding spatially modulated and enhanced magnetic proximity. The moiré proximity effect is demonstrated via an imprinted moiré potential on CrI3 layer and its feedback to the direct moiré potential on WSe2 bilayers is observed. The cooperation between the direct and imprinted moiré potentials is shown to yield novel topological and correlated states.

Abstract: The spiral handedness of magnetic moments, referred to as chirality, gives rise to emergent electromagnetic phenomena in helimagnets. In insulating helimagnets, known as multiferroics, the cycloidal spin structure induces electric polarization by utilizing the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism. Spin-polarized neutron diffraction experiments, which directly probe circular spin arrangements, clearly demonstrated that an electric field controlled the chirality in multiferroic helimagnets. On the other hand, it was unclear until recently how the chirality could be controlled in metallic helimagnets where a large electric field cannot be applied, while the chirality control technique in metallic helimagnets should enable the exploration of chirality-dependent spintronic functionalities. Recently, Jiang et al. succeeded in controlling the chirality of a spiral structure by the simultaneous application of a magnetic field and electric current in a metallic helimagnet, utilizing the nonreciprocal electronic transport as an indirect probe of chirality, highlighting the need for a neutron diffraction experiment that directly probes the chirality. Here, we directly demonstrate the chirality control in a metallic helimagnet YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ by means of spin-polarized neutron diffraction, which should give rise to a firm basis for the development of future helimagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: Understanding the crystallization pathways of water-rich ammonia-water (NH3-H2O) solutions and the stability of ammonia hydrates is key to unraveling the behavior of complex hydrogen-bonding networks as well as for planetary interior modelling. Yet, there are still inconsistencies in the crystallization sequence reported upon pressure-induced crystallization of H2O-rich NH3-H2O solutions at room temperature. Here, we investigate the effect of compression rates on the crystallization pathways of 25 wt% NH3 aqueous solutions at room temperature using dynamically compressed diamond anvil cells (dDAC) coupled with time-resolved X-ray diffraction. We show that compression rates exceeding 0.5 GPa/sec promote direct crystallization of a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase (DMA') with possible AMH stoichiometry coexisting with H2O ice VII, while rates below 0.2 GPa/sec stabilize monoclinic NH3-rich AHH-II and ice VII phases. Intermediate rates between 0.2-0.5 GPa/sec produce a mixture of both hydrates alongside ice VII, hence demonstrating the role of compression rate on the crystallization sequence of ammonia solutions. The compression behavior and phase stability of the distinct phase assemblies (AHH-II/DMA' + ice VII) are investigated further to place constraints on the composition of the DMA' phase, the effect of ice VII on the compressibility of ammonia hydrates, and the plausible incorporation of NH3 impurities within the lattice of high-pressure ice phases.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium phonon transport driven by nanoscale hotspot heating in silicon device layers governs heat dissipation in advanced microelectronics and underscores the need for a better microscopic understanding of such processes. Yet the origin of the frequently observed logarithmic (ln) dependence of the apparent thermal response on hotspot size in crystalline silicon, and the role of individual phonon modes in this regime, remain unclear. Here, we develop a semianalytical, mode-resolved framework in the spectral phonon mean free path (MFP) domain and validate it against a full-phonon-dispersion Boltzmann transport model for heat removal from a 10 x 10 nm^2 hotspot in a thin Si layer (thicknesses of 41, 78, and 177 nm) representative of a silicon-on-insulator transistor. We show that ln-type quasiballistic scaling arises only for modes that lie on a log-uniform conductivity plateau and are diffusive-side or quasiballistic with respect to the hotspot size, whereas fully ballistic long-MFP modes contribute a saturated, nonlogarithmic background, leading to extremely slow suppression of their heat-carrying capability. The resulting phonon-modal nonlocal spectrum establishes spectral selection rules for ln-regime transport in confined Si and provides a compact basis for incorporating mode-selective quasiballistic corrections into continuum thermal models and for interpreting phonon-resolved thermometry experiments.

Abstract: The transport dynamics of itinerant charge carriers and their interactions with the environment. For two-dimensional oxide thermoelectrics, predominantly represented by doped SrTiO3-based superlattices, reduced spatial dimensions and increased effective mass are known to enhance thermopower (S). However, because of their large effective Bohr radius resulting from their high dielectric constant, SrTiO3-based systems have limitations in exhibiting the 2D characteristic. Here, we focus on EuTiO3 as an alternative perovskite platform in which fractional LaxEu1-xTiO3/EuTiO3 artificial superlattices demonstrate the improvement in 2D nature for the dimensionality-induced improvement of S. We observed a quasi-2D thermopower S2D of -950 uV K-1 and S2D/S3D of ~20 resulting from the improved 2D confinement. Thermopower measurements, combined with hybrid density functional theory calculations, show the enhanced S originates from the confinement of Ti 3dxy-states within the LaxEu1-xTiO3 layers and the associated increase in the 2D density of states. In detail, a smaller effective Bohr radius and modified electronic band structures, in conjunction with the presence of the Eu 4f-states in EuTiO3 which modified the local electronic potential and strengthened the spatial confinement of Ti 3d-states. This approach to improving the dimensional confinement establishes a small effective Bohr radius and Eu 4f-state assisted 2D confinement provides valuable insights into the design of high-performance applications in artificial oxide superlattices.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of light interstitial elements in multicomponent alloys remains challenging due to the complexity of local chemical environments and the high computational cost of first-principles calculations. Here we demonstrate that three universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) - MACE-MATPES-PBE-0, Orb-v3, and SevenNet-0 can efficiently map the energetics of C, N, O, and H interstitials in a Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT). All uMLIPs predict broad energy distributions (1-3 eV) for all four interstitial elements, reflecting their strong sensitivity to local lattice chemistry. Despite alloy disorder, MACE-MATPES-PBE-0 and Orb-v3 reproduce the expected site preferences of the bcc structure: C, N, and O relax into octahedral sites, whereas H stabilizes in tetrahedral positions. In contrast, SevenNet-0 predicts H to be most stable in octahedral coordination, indicating a limitation of this model. Correlation analysis reveals two dominant chemical trends: Ti-rich environments strongly stabilize interstitials, whereas close proximity to Nb is destabilizing; Zr and Ta show no statistically significant influence, likely due to their low concentrations. Benchmarking representative O interstitial configurations against DFT confirms that the uMLIPs reasonably reproduce the energetic ordering of chemically distinct environments. Overall, these results demonstrate that uMLIPs enable computationally efficient, statistically converged characterization of defect energetics in gum metal base alloy and provide insight into how local chemical environments govern interstitial stability.

Abstract: Among van der Waals crystals, transition metal trihalide VI3 has driven attention for its magnetic and orbital properties. However, its chemical instability under ambient conditions make its exploitation challenging for technological implementation. In this context, here we show how synchrotron radiation soft X-rays partially restore stoichiometric chemical and electronic properties of VI3 crystals. By combining X-ray absorption and X-ray photoemission spectroscopies, we show as-cleaved and aged (in ultra-high vacuum conditions) chemical degradation of VI3 crystal surface, with the formation of vanadates, and its, at least partial, recovery under high-flux soft X-ray beam exposure, revealing that superficial hygroscopic contamination couples relatively weakly to the crystal surface.

Abstract: Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and related organic materials are promising platforms for next-generation memory and energy-storage technologies due to their redox activity, ionic mobility, and compatibility with low-cost and scalable fabrication. Electrodeposited Prussian Blue (PB) and Prussian White (PW) thin films show robust resistive switching with ON/OFF ratios from one to three orders of magnitude in both bipolar and unipolar modes. Structural and spectroscopic analyses reveal homogeneous films with well-defined grain boundaries and ionic pathways that enable filamentary conduction. Current-voltage measurements, impedance spectroscopy, and quantum transport modeling indicate switching mechanisms governed by ohmic or space-charge-limited conduction, driven by potassium-ion migration and reversible redox processes. PB-based devices also exhibit conductance quantization with discrete steps at integer and half-integer multiples of G0, consistent with ballistic electron transport through atomic-scale channels. Complementary studies on perylene-based liquid crystals and FeHCF on graphene oxide highlight the versatility of PBAs for memory and supercapacitor applications. Together, these results demonstrate the multifunctionality and scalability of PBAs for future ReRAM, neuromorphic computing, multilevel memory, cryptographic hardware, and high-performance energy-storage devices.

Abstract: Metal-assisted exfoliation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as an efficient route to isolating large-area monolayer crystals, yet the influence of the supporting metal substrate on their intrinsic properties remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate successful gold-assisted exfoliation of monolayer IrTe$_2$ up to the millimeter scale. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), combined with first-principles calculations, reveals that the low-energy electronic structure closely resembles that of a freestanding monolayer 1T-IrTe$_2$. We find that quasi-covalent hybridization together with substrate-induced strain leads to only modest modifications of the electronic bands. Although strain contributes to phase stability, it is essentially hybridization that drives the stabilization of the 1T-phase of the monolayer IrTe$_2$ by suppressing stripe-ordered phase transitions. These results establish gold-assisted exfoliation as a robust route to prepare a large-area monolayer IrTe$_2$ and highlight the role of metal-substrate interaction in engineering 2D materials with tailored structural phases.

Abstract: The practical strength of oxide glasses is greatly reduced by surface flaws that form during processing and use. Instrumented indentation can mimic such real-life damage events and induce flaws and cracking under controlled conditions. At the same time, instrumented indentation allows for systematic examination of the deformation and structural changes of the regions of the glass being indented. However, structural probing is nearly always performed after rather than during the sharp contact event, limiting our understanding of the indentation process. To overcome this, we here demonstrate the use of nanofocus X-ray scattering experiments to probe the local mechanical and structural response of vitreous silica during indentation. Two-dimensional mapping of the scattering pattern in the zone below a sharp diamond wedge indenter reveals local changes in the atomic structure and density as well as cracking behavior. These in situ experiments during indentation reveal the formation and evolution of the densification zone and cracking with nanoscale resolution. Understanding the interplay between structural densification and cracking behavior in glasses is deepened through this work, which is crucial for the development of more damage-resistant and thus stronger glasses as well as fundamental understanding of glass deformation mechanisms.

Abstract: Trigonal solid-state defects are often subjects of spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by the $E\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller effect, reflecting strong electron-phonon coupling. These systems, particularly paramagnetic defect qubits in solids are central for quantum technology applications, where accurate knowledge of their fine-structure parameters $-$ shaped by the complex interplay of spin-orbit and electron-phonon interactions $-$ is essential. We introduce the $\mathtt{Exe.py}$ code part of the $\mathtt{jahn {\text -} teller {\text -} dynamics}$ package, a Python code that implements the first-principles approach of [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021063 (2018)] to accurately compute the spin-orbit-phonon entanglement in trigonal defects utilizing the output from density functional theory calculations (DFT). By employing $Δ$SCF calculations, the method extends naturally to excited states and predicts fine-structure parameters of zero-phonon lines (ZPLs), including Zeeman shifts under external magnetic fields. The approach is applicable not only to solid-state defects but also to Jahn-Teller active trigonal molecules such as the $X$CH$_3$ family. We demonstrate the capabilities of Exe.py through applications to negatively charged Group-IV$-$vacancy (G4V) defects in diamond: SiV$^-$, GeV$^-$, SnV$^-$, PbV$^-$ and the neutral N$_3$V$^0$ defect in diamond, and the CH$_3$O methoxy molecule.

Abstract: We measure the polarization change of a beam reflected from the surface of both crystalline alpha and amorphous SiO2 samples while they are photo-excited by an intense light pulse, at intensities above the nonlinear excitation threshold yet below the damage threshold. The polarization change varies with the angle between the polarization of pump and probe light, but is found to be independent of their orientation relative to the crystal axes. This behavior differs between the reflected and transmitted beams, and can be modeled by taking into account a birefringence induced by the electric field of the pump. These polarization-change effects can be very strong, with polarization rotation exceeding 90°, at pump intensities well below the damage threshold. We also observe a markedly different behavior of the reflected beam depending on whether the material is crystalline or amorphous.

TL;DR: 本文研究了二维钙钛矿纳米片中声子的对称性效应，发现不同振动模式（Ag和B1g）随层数变化的规律不同，并据此提出了一种通过拉曼光谱无损测量纳米片厚度的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究卤化物钙钛矿中量子限制对振动模式对称性效应的作用，这个问题先前尚未解决。

Method: 研究人员合成了2-5个单层（MLs）厚度的二维CsPbBr3纳米片，并结合偏振分辨拉曼光谱实验与第一性原理计算进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，随着纳米片厚度增加，B1g振动模式遵循声子限制模型而增强，但Ag模式则偏离该模型。理论计算表明B1g模式主要在平面内振动，而Ag模式与平面外畸变耦合，更易受表面和尺寸效应影响。基于此，研究者们建立了拉曼光谱中A1g/B1g强度比与纳米片厚度之间的精确关系，可作为一种无损测量手段。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示的对称性驱动的声子局域化二分法为理解层状钙钛矿提供了通用框架，并凸显了对称性工程在理解和控制低维光电材料中声子、激子及其相互作用方面的重要性。

Abstract: Quantum confinement not only reshapes electronic states but also reorganizes the vibrational landscape of low-dimensional semiconductors. In halide perovskites, however, the role of confinement in governing symmetry effects on vibrational modes has remained unresolved. Here we synthesize 2D CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with atomically defined thicknesses for 2-5 monolayers (MLs) and perform exciton absorption and emission analysis, crystalline phase determination, and phonon analysis. The lowest dimensional structure (2 MLs) reveal a co-existence of cubic and orthorhombic structure, energetically converging to orthorhombic for 3 MLs and beyond. Through polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles theory for 2-5 MLs, a striking symmetry contrast is found: B1g modes intensify and evolve in line with the phonon-confinement model, while Ag modes deviate, reflecting their distinct spatial localization. First principles calculations show that B1g vibrational modes largely reside in the xy-plane, Pb-Br-Pb units connect octahedra along the xy-direction with increased lattice dynamics as inner layers accumulate, whereas A1g vibrations couple to out-of-plane distortions and remain susceptible to surface disorder and finite-size effects. This symmetry-driven dichotomy provides a general framework for understanding phonon localization in layered halide perovskites. Beyond mechanism, we establish Raman fingerprints, particularly the A1g/B1g intensity ratio in cross-polarized geometry, as a calibrated, non-destructive metrology for 2D nanoplatelet thickness through 2-5 MLs. These results bridge electronic and phonon confinement and highlight symmetry engineering as a route to understand and control phonons, excitons, and their interactions in low-dimensional optoelectronic materials.

Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectrics have recently emerged as a promising avenue for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Due to the intrinsic absence of inversion symmetry, 2D ferroelectrics exhibit bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which relies on hot, non-thermalized photo-excited carriers to generate a photo-induced current with enhanced performances thanks to efficient charge separation mechanisms. The absence of a required p-n junction architecture makes these materials particularly attractive for nanoscale energy harvesting. Recent studies have reported enhanced BPVE in nanometer-thick CuInP$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric embedded between two graphene wafers, driven by relatively strong polarization and reduced dimensionality. Short circuit photocurrent density values have been observed to reach up to mA/cm$^2$. In this paper, we demonstrate that the shift-current mechanism alone cannot fully account for these high conductivity values, suggesting that additional mechanisms may play a significant role. Furthermore, our work confirms the existence of a strong size effect, which drastically reduces the shift-conductivity response in the bulk limit, in agreement with experimental observations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学（MD）模拟产生了大量高维数据，但将其转化为可解释的变形模式图谱既消耗资源又主要依赖人工操作。本研究旨在通过机器学习自动化这一解释过程。

Method: 首先，通过自动编码器将从CuNi合金模拟中获得的晶粒取向着色图像压缩成32维的全局特征向量。然后，将学习到的表示与模拟元数据（如成分、负载、时间等）结合，训练一个CNN-MLP模型来预测主要的变形模式。

Result: 该模型在验证数据上实现了约96%的预测准确率。经过压缩后重建的图像仍然保留了晶界、堆垛层错等关键的微观结构特征，证明了机器学习可以从结构图像中自动识别和分类摩擦学的变形特征。

Conclusion: 这项概念验证工作是向全自动、数据驱动构建摩擦学机制图谱迈出的第一步，最终可能发展出预测性建模框架，从而减少对大规模分子动力学模拟的需求。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become indispensable for exploring tribological deformation patterns at the atomic scale. However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns.

TL;DR: 本文通过结合计算和实验，揭示了亚稳态$α$-Li$_3$PS$_4$固态电解质的形成机理，发现其在纳米尺度下的低表面能是其能够低温快速合成并保持亚稳态的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释$α$-Li$_3$PS$_4$固态电解质的形成悖论：它作为高温稳定相，冷却后应转变为$γ$相，但实际上却可以在较低温度下快速合成并以亚稳态形式存在。其根本原因尚不清楚。

Method: 研究者构建了一个综合的时间-温度-相变（TTT）图。该方法结合了：1）基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算，建立了温度-尺寸相图；2）高时间分辨率的等温测量实验；3）利用原位同步辐射X射线衍射和电子显微镜技术进行直接观测。

Result: 计算表明，在纳米尺度下，$α$相因其低表面能而变得稳定，这在很宽的温度范围内显著降低了其成核能垒。实验直接观察证实了纳米尺寸$α$相的快速成核及其随后的缓慢相变过程。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了纳米尺度的表面能是稳定亚稳态$α$-Li$_3$PS$_4$的关键。研究提供了一个结合热力学和动力学因素的通用框架，为理解成核与相变机制，以及定向合成其他功能性亚稳态材料提供了理论指导和策略。

Abstract: $α$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ is a promising solid-state electrolyte with the highest ionic conductivity among its polymorphs. However, its formation presents a thermodynamic paradox: the $α$-phase is the equilibrium phase at high temperature and transforms to the stable $γ$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ polymorph when cooled to room temperature; however, $α$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ can be synthesized and quenched in a metastable state via rapid heating at relatively low temperatures. The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $α$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. This size-dependent stabilization is directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $α$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation. This work presents a generalizable framework that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic factors for understanding nucleation and phase transformation mechanisms, providing a rational strategy for the targeted synthesis of functional metastable materials.

Abstract: The observation of reversible de-mixing phenomena in mixed-halide perovskites under illumination is one of the most challenging as well as intriguing aspects of this class of materials. On the one hand, it poses critical constraints to the compositional space that allows reliable design of absorbers for perovskite photovoltaics. On the other hand, it holds potential for the development of novel optoionic devices where an ionic response is triggered via optical stimuli. Funda-mental questions about the origin of such photo de-mixing process remain unanswered, both in terms of its mechanism as well as thermodynamic description. Here, we relate in-situ measurements of ionic and electronic transport of mixed bromide-iodide perovskite thin films performed during photo de-mixing with the evolution of their optical and morpho-logical properties. The results point to the definition of different stages of the de-mixing process which, based on micros-copy and spectroscopic measurements, we assign to regimes of spinodal decomposition and nucleation of quasi-equilibrium iodide- and bromide-rich phases. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we explore the role of dimensionality in the mechanism and reversibility of photo de-mixing and dark re-mixing processes, referring to elec-tronic and ionic contributions to the de-mixing driving force. Additionally, our data emphasizes the role of the surface, as significantly different de-mixing dynamics, in terms of extent and reversibility, are observed for films with or without encapsulation. Our comprehensive analysis of transport, phase and optical properties of mixed-halide perovskites pro-vides guidelines for future materials design as well as for the more general fundamental understanding of light-induced ionic phenomena.

Abstract: Predicting the glass-forming ability (GFA) of chemical compositions remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for oxide glasses with broad compositional diversity. Traditional empirical and thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear factors governing vitrification. In this study, we applied two ensemble machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-to the glass_ternary_hipt dataset to predict the GFA of ternary oxide glasses directly from composition-derived descriptors. Both models achieved excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.92, MAE < 0.04), confirming that GFA is learnable from compositional features alone. Feature importance analysis revealed that electronegativity variance, atomic size mismatch, and valence electron descriptors are the most influential factors, while cohesive energy and ionic radius provided secondary contributions. These chemically interpretable features align with established theories of glass formation, thereby bridging predictive performance with physical understanding. The novelty of this work lies in systematically extending ML-based predictive modeling to ternary oxide glasses, a class less studied compared to metallic and binary systems. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning not only enables accurate GFA prediction but also provides actionable insights for designing new glass compositions with enhanced stability.

Motivation: 计算机和机器学习驱动的催化剂发现是一个主要研究焦点，这些方法通常使用热力学过电位作为关键参数。本文旨在探讨这种方法在大规模筛选催化剂候选材料时的适用性和可靠性。

Method: 研究人员利用Open Catalyst Project（OC20和OC22）的大规模数据集，首先量化了第一性原理方法预测吸附能的不确定性，然后计算了数据集中所有材料对于析氢和析氧反应的过电位，并以此评估该指标的筛选能力。

Result: 研究发现，吸附能的预测不确定性高达0.3-0.5 eV。尽管过电位能够识别出铂等已知催化剂，但巨大的不确定性会将大量材料错误地归类为“良好”，从而限制了其作为筛选标准的价值。

Conclusion: 研究者质疑将过电位作为催化剂筛选主要指标的可靠性，并呼吁学术界将研究重点转移到其他更实际的指标上，如可合成性、稳定性、寿命或成本。

Abstract: As a core technology for green chemical synthesis and electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis is central to decarbonization strategies aimed at combating climate change. In this context, computational and machine learning driven catalyst discovery has emerged as a major research focus. These approaches frequently use the thermodynamic overpotential, calculated from adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates, as a key parameter in their analysis. In this paper, we explore the large-scale applicability of such overpotential estimates for identifying good catalyst candidates by using datasets from the Open Catalyst Project (OC20 and OC22). We start by quantifying the uncertainty in predicting adsorption energies using \textit{ab initio} methods and find that $\sim$0.3-0.5 eV is a conservative estimate for a single adsorption energy prediction. We then compute the overpotential of all materials in the OC20 and OC22 datasets for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. We find that while the overpotential allows the identification of known good catalysts such as platinum and iridium oxides, the uncertainty is large enough to misclassify a broad fraction of the datasets as ``good'', which limits its value as a screening criterion. These results question the reliance on overpotential estimation as a primary evaluation metric to sort through catalyst candidates and calls for a shift in focus in the computational catalysis and machine learning communities towards other metrics such as synthesizability, stability, lifetime or affordability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探索一种更有效的方法来优化铁基超导体的性能，特别是提高其临界温度（Tc）和临界电流密度（Jc），以满足基础研究和未来高场应用的需求。

Method: 研究人员使用原位立方六面砧高压技术（CA-HP），在4 GPa的压力下合成了一系列SmFeAsO1-xFx块状样品。并通过结构、微观结构、拉曼光谱、输运和磁性测量等多种手段对样品进行了表征。

Result: 成功实现了氟对氧的有效替代。在欠掺杂区，超导转变温度（Tc）提高了10-17 K，临界电流密度（Jc）提高了一个数量级。上临界场（Hc2）高达约200 T。超导相图呈现圆顶状趋势，在最佳掺杂区，Tc最高达到57 K，Jc达到10^4 A-cm^-2。与传统方法相比，高压合成在整个氟掺杂范围内同时提升了Tc和Jc。

Conclusion: 高压合成被证实是一种优化铁基超导体性能的高效方法，该方法在基础科学研究和未来的高场应用中都显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples are synthesized using an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) technique at 4 GPa and are characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. A systematic reduction of lattice parameters and unit-cell volume confirms effective fluorine substitution at oxygen sites, while Raman spectroscopy reveals electron doping and subtle changes in local bonding environments. In the underdoped regime, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude. The upper critical field (Hc2), estimated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, reaches ~200 T, indicating strong spin paramagnetic effects and multiband superconductivity. Resistive broadening under applied fields follows Arrhenius behavior, with the activation energy showing a power-law field dependence that decreases rapidly at higher fields, consistent with collective vortex pinning. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A-cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. A direct comparison with CSP samples demonstrates that high-pressure synthesis simultaneously enhances both Tc and Jc across the entire fluorine-doping range. These findings establish high-pressure growth as a highly effective approach for optimizing iron-based superconductors and underscore its potential for both fundamental research and future high field applications.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect is one of the nonreciprocal transport phenomena, where the critical current depends on the current direction. This effect is typically realized in superconductors with broken spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry. To break the time-reversal symmetry, external magnetic fields are commonly used. Here, we demonstrate a sign-controllable superconducting diode effect under zero external magnetic field in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$. The sign of the zero-field superconducting diode effect is controlled by the poling magnetic field, that is a large magnetic field applied prior to measurements. This result indicates that trapped magnetic flux are responsible for breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Our findings highlight the crucial role of trapped magnetic flux in generating the superconducting diode effect and provide a general pathway for realizing a zero-field superconducting diode effect.

Motivation: 传统上，对于特定氧化态（+1.5）的硼碳包合物（XYB6C6），其稳定性和超导转变温度一直存在争议，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 研究使用了随机自洽谐波近似（stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation）与机器学习相结合的方法来分析量子非谐效应。

Result: 研究发现，非谐效应主要源于客体金属原子，它能稳定原本不稳定的RbPbB6C6结构。稳定后的RbPbB6C6预测超导转变温度高达88K，并表现出双能隙超导特性。

Conclusion: 量子非谐效应是决定XYB6C6包合物稳定性和超导电性的关键因素，这表明强非谐效应并非仅存在于富氢化合物中。

Abstract: Traditionally, strong quantum anharmonic effects have been considered a characteristic of hydrogen-rich compounds. Here we propose that these effects also play a decisive role in boron-carbon clathrates. The stability and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of carbon-boron clathrates XYB6C6, whose metal atoms have an average oxidation state of +1.5, have long remained under debate. At this oxidation state, some combinations (e.g., RbSrB6C6) are dynamically stable, whereas others (e.g., RbPbB6C6) are not. Using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation combined with machine learning, we find that the anharmonicity originates primarily from guest metal atoms. For comparison, we find that quantum fluctuations have negligible influence on SrB3C3, but remove the lattice instability of RbPbB6C6. The predicted Tc of RbPbB6C6 (88 K) is nearly twice that of SrB3C3. Moreover, RbPbB6C6 exhibits two-gap superconductivity due to the higher C/B ratio in the density of states at the Fermi level compared to SrB3C3, weakening the sp3 hybridization. These findings demonstrate that quantum anharmonicity crucially governs the stability and superconductivity of XYB6C6 clathrates.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了范德华异质结构中层间超导与铁电性的相互作用，发现铁电畴壁可以增强超导，并分析了磁场对不同自旋配对超导态的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探究范德华（vdW）异质结构中，层间超导与滑移铁电性这两种现象并存时的相互作用及其独有特征，这与近期的实验数据密切相关。

Method: 研究采用准经典Eilenberger方程框架，对一个隧道耦合的双层模型进行分析。该模型通过层间导带的非均匀相对位移来描述滑移铁电体中的净电荷转移。

Result: 研究发现，在铁电畴壁附近，超导临界温度可以被显著提高。增加隧穿振幅对自旋单重态和三重态超导的影响相反。此外，面内磁场的轨道效应会抑制单重态超导但增强三重态超导，而顺磁效应则可能导致重入超导相和临界温度随磁场非单调变化等复杂行为。

Conclusion: 论文的理论结果为理解和解释近期在同时存在超导与滑移铁电性的范德华结构中观察到的实验数据提供了理论框架，并揭示了调控层间超导性的新可能性，尤其是在磁场和铁电畴工程方面。

Abstract: We study the distinctive features of the interplay between the interlayer superconductivity and ferroelectricity in van der Waals heterostructures. Corresponding analysis is carried out within the framework of the quasiclassical Eilenberger equations for a tunnel coupled bilayer with inhomogeneous relative shift of the conduction bands between the layers, which describes the net charge transfer in sliding ferroelectrics. It is shown that the critical temperature of the interlayer superconductivity can be significantly enhanced for superconducting nuclei localized in the vicinity of ferroelectric domain walls. We demonstrate that the increase in the tunneling amplitude leads to the decrease (increase) in the difference between the critical temperatures for localized and homogeneous superconducting states for the spin-singlet (spin-triplet) interlayer superconductivity. We also perform an extensive analysis of the effects of the in-plane magnetic field on the interlayer superconductivity. It is shown that the orbital effect can result in the suppression of the spin-singlet interlayer superconductivity and to the enhancement of the spin-triplet one. We find that possible manifestations of the paramagnetic effect include the suppression of the interlayer superconductivity by rather weak Zeeman fields, the two-fold anisotropy of the critical magnetic field for the spin-triplet states as well as the appearance of the reentrant superconducting phases. It is shown that the joint influence of the orbital and paramagnetic mechanisms on the spin-triplet interlayer superconductivity can even lead to a nonmonotonic behavior of the superconducting critical temperature as a function of the external magnetic field. The obtained results are discussed in the context of recent experimental data on van der Waals structures with coexisting superconductivity and sliding ferroelectricity.

### [32] [Convolution-FFT for option pricing in the Heston model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05326)
*Xiang Gao,Cody Hyndman*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 本文针对Heston模型下的欧式期权定价，提出了一种新的卷积-FFT方法，该方法计算稳定，并且首次给出了完全解析的误差界，实现了高精度和高效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于傅里叶变换的期权定价方法存在不稳定性问题，通常需要进行复杂的分支切割调整或依赖经验性调整的阻尼参数，特别是在处理高频振荡时，计算结果不够稳定和精确。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于卷积和快速傅里叶变换（FFT）的方法。该方法的核心是使用联合特征函数的连续可微表示，从而产生一个即使在高频振荡下也保持稳定的被积函数。

Result: 该方法首次为Heston模型下的FFT卷积方法提供了完全解析、闭式的误差界（包括截断误差和离散化误差）。数值实验证实了理论推导的收敛速度，并表明该方法能以适度的计算成本实现鲁棒且高精度的期权定价。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的卷积-FFT方法是一种高效、稳健且准确的Heston模型期权定价工具，其主要创新在于提供了可解析量化的误差界限，增强了方法的可靠性与实用性。

Abstract: We propose a convolution-FFT method for pricing European options under the Heston model that leverages a continuously differentiable representation of the joint characteristic function. Unlike existing Fourier-based methods that rely on branch-cut adjustments or empirically tuned damping parameters, our approach yields a stable integrand even under large frequency oscillations. Crucially, we derive fully analytical error bounds that quantify both truncation error and discretization error in terms of model parameters and grid settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide such explicit, closed-form error estimates for an FFT-based convolution method specialized to the Heston model. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robust, high-accuracy option pricing at modest computational cost.

Abstract: In regulated domains such as finance, the integrity and governance of data pipelines are critical - yet existing systems treat data quality control (QC) as an isolated preprocessing step rather than a first-class system component. We present a unified AI-driven Data QC and DataOps Management framework that embeds rule-based, statistical, and AI-based QC methods into a continuous, governed layer spanning ingestion, model pipelines, and downstream applications. Our architecture integrates open-source tools with custom modules for profiling, audit logging, breach handling, configuration-driven policies, and dynamic remediation. We demonstrate deployment in a production-grade financial setup: handling streaming and tabular data across multiple asset classes and transaction streams, with configurable thresholds, cloud-native storage interfaces, and automated alerts. We show empirical gains in anomaly detection recall, reduction of manual remediation effort, and improved auditability and traceability in high-throughput data workflows. By treating QC as a system concern rather than an afterthought, our framework provides a foundation for trustworthy, scalable, and compliant AI pipelines in regulated environments.

Abstract: A novel, conservative discontinuous Galerkin algorithm is presented for particle kinetics on manifolds. The motion of particles on the manifold is represented using using both canonical and non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations. Our schemes apply to either formulations, but the canonical formulation results in a particularly efficient scheme that also conserves particle density and energy exactly. The collisionless update is coupled to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator that provides a simplified model for relaxation to local thermodynamic equilibrium. An iterative scheme is constructed to ensure collisional invariants (density, momentum and energy) are preserved numerically. Rotation of the manifold is incorporated by modifying the Hamiltonian while ensuring a canonical formulation. Several test problems, including a kinetic version of the classical Sod-shock problem, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surfaces of a sphere and a paraboloid, with and without rotations, is presented. A prospectus for further development of this approach to simulation of kinetic theory in general relativity is presented.

Abstract: Digital assays represent a shift from traditional diagnostics and enable the precise detection of low-abundance analytes, critical for early disease diagnosis and personalized medicine, through discrete counting of biomolecular reporters. Within this paradigm, we present a particle counting algorithm for nanoparticle based imaging assays, formulated as a multiple-hypothesis statistical test under an explicit image-formation model and evaluated using a penalized likelihood rule. In contrast to thresholding or machine learning methods, this approach requires no training data or empirical parameter tuning, and its outputs remain interpretable through direct links to imaging physics and statistical decision theory.
  Through numerical simulations we demonstrate robust count accuracy across weak signals, variable backgrounds, magnification changes and moderate PSF mismatch. Particle resolvability tests further reveal characteristic error modes, including under-counting at very small separations and localized over-counting near the resolution limit. Practically, we also confirm the algorithm's utility, through application to experimental dark-field images comprising a nanoparticle-based assay for detection of DNA biomarkers derived from SARS-CoV-2. Statistically significant differences in particle count distributions are observed between control and positive samples. Full count statistics obtained further exhibit consistent over-dispersion, and provide insight into non-specific and target-induced particle aggregation. These results establish our method as a reliable framework for nanoparticle-based detection assays in digital molecular diagnostics.

Abstract: Atomistic foundation models constitute a paradigm shift in computational materials science by providing universal machine-learned interatomic potentials with broad transferability across chemical spaces. Although fine-tuning is essential for adapting these pretrained models to specific target systems, the influence of the optimization algorithm on this process remains insufficiently characterized. In this work, we perform a rigorous benchmark of seven first-order optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, SGD, LAMB, Ranger, and ScheduleFree, for the fine-tuning of foundation models across molecular, crystalline, and liquid regimes. We evaluate these algorithms based on energy and force accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution configurations, as well as their impact on downstream physical properties such as elastic moduli, phonon spectra, and interfacial dynamics. We interpret these empirical results through a preconditioning framework that views each optimizer as a data-dependent linear transformation of the gradient. This analysis clarifies how different update rules impose specific spectral filters on the effective loss Hessian. Across all regimes, AdamW and ScheduleFree achieve superior curvature conditioning and force accuracy, whereas stochastic gradient descent exhibits slow convergence and instability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a brief second-order refinement stage reduces residual anisotropy in the loss landscape and enhances the fidelity of physical observables without increasing inference costs. These findings provide conceptual insight and practical guidance for selecting and designing optimizers to ensure the stable and efficient fine-tuning of universal interatomic potentials.

Abstract: We present a continuous nonlinear optimization model for the Spin Glass Problem (SGP), building on a classical result by Rosenberg (1972), which shows that for a class of multilinear polynomial problems the optimal values of the continuous relaxation and the corresponding discrete model coincide. Using the SGP as a case study, we provide a simple, problem-specific argument showing how any optimal solution returned by a continuous solver can be converted into an optimal discrete spin configuration, even when the solver outputs non-integer values. The relaxed model remains nonconvex and does not alter the inherent computational hardness of the problem, but it offers a direct and conceptually transparent continuous formulation that can be handled by modern global optimization software. Computational experiments on standard benchmark instances indicate that this approach can match, and in several cases surpass, recent integer programming linearization techniques, making it a practical and complementary tool for researchers working at the interface between statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了具有强无序和强排斥相互作用的一维费米-哈伯德模型，并发现在开放边界条件下，强相互作用会克服无序导致的局域化，使得不同自旋在系统两端分离聚集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为，无序和相互作用的结合通常会导致多体局域化（MBL）。作者旨在探究在一维费米-哈伯德模型中，尤其是在开放边界条件下，强无序和强排斥相互作用之间会产生怎样的相互影响。

Method: 作者通过研究具有开放边界条件的一维费米-哈伯德模型，并进行了一个严格的厄米极限下的对照实验，以区分他们观察到的现象与非厄米趋肤效应（NHSE）。通过分析系统的多体能量和能量敏感性，他们探究了现象背后的物理机制。

Result: 研究发现，强排斥相互作用能克服无序引起的局域化，使系统进入一种宏观上的“相互作用诱导的分离”相：不同自旋粒子会分别聚集在系统的两端。研究证明其根本驱动力是多体能量最小化，而非非互易性（non-reciprocity）。该分离表现为一个急剧的热力学交叉，并伴随着发散的能量磁化率。

Conclusion: 该研究结果挑战了关于开放量子系统中无序与相互作用竞争的传统理解。它表明，强相互作用不仅不会增强局域化，反而可能通过诱导宏观空间分离来克服局域化效应。

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between strong disorder and repulsive interactions in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model under open boundary conditions. While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This "interaction-induced segregation" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全球氦-3供应日益紧张，低于1K的制冷技术重新受到关注。传统的ADR材料（水合盐）在加热或真空下会降解，而新型稀土氧化物不仅熵密度更高，且性能稳定，因此需要探索更多此类材料。

Method: 研究人员合成了四种稀土硼酸盐（Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ 和 Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$，其中 X 为 Yb 或 Gd），并测量了它们的结构、磁性和热力学性质。随后，他们评估了这些材料从2K温度和5T磁场开始的绝热去磁制冷（ADR）性能。

Result: 在测试的四种材料中，除了Ba$_3$GdB$_9$O$_{18}$在108mK发生磁有序外，其他三种材料在极低温度下仍保持顺磁性，这对于ADR应用是有利的。论文分析了它们的ADR性能并与文献结果进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该研究的稀土硼酸盐是绝热去磁制冷（ADR）应用的可行候选材料，相比传统材料具有更好的实用优势。

Abstract: Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) is regaining relevance for the refrigeration to temperatures below 1 K as global helium-3 supply is increasingly strained. While ADR at these temperatures is long established with paramagnetic hydrated salts, more recently frustrated rare-earth oxides were found to offer higher entropy densities and practical advantages since they do not degrade under heating or evacuation. We report structural, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the rare-earth borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ with X = (Yb, Gd). Except for Ba$_3$GdB$_9$O$_{18}$, which orders at 108 mK, the three other materials remain paramagnetic down to their lowest measured temperatures. ADR performance starting at 2 K in a field of 5 T is analyzed and compared to literature results.

Abstract: Cr$_{1+δ}$Te$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, displays a contested magnetic structure, poised between collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. In this work, we investigate the magnetic structure of Cr$_{1.33}$Te$_2$ at the microscopic level by combining single-crystal neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a distinct collinear spin alignment, whereas spectroscopic analyses reveal inherent structural vacancies at both Cr and Te sites. These vacancies lead to local symmetry breaking that elevates the orbital degeneracy of the Cr 3$d$ states, as demonstrated by our first-principles analysis. The resulting modification of magnetocrystalline anisotropy emerges as the key mechanism stabilising the collinear magnetic ground state over the non-collinear one in the presence of vacancies. Our findings uncover a vacancy-driven route to control spin anisotropy and magnetic ordering in layered ferromagnets, offering new insights into the design of tunable 2D magnetic materials.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个腿部之间存在位移的梯形模型。该位移产生的莫尔势与库仑相互作用共同导致了一种激子性的非公度电荷密度波（CDW）。研究识别了其集体激发模式（希格斯模式和戈德斯通模式/相子），并指出层状材料中微小的失配会产生显著影响，这或许能解释HfTe3中的CDW相。

Motivation: 本文旨在理解非公度电荷密度波（CDW）及其低能激发（相子）的性质，特别是在层状材料中层间失配（如晶格位移）所带来的影响。同时，希望通过该理论模型解释准一维化合物HfTe3中神秘的CDW相的物理本质。

Method: 作者采用一个半填充的四带梯形理论模型。他们在模型的两腿之间引入了一个位移 δ=p/q 来模拟层间失配，从而产生莫尔势。接着，在模型中加入短程库仑相互作用，并分析最终的基态及其集体激发模式。

Result: 研究发现，腿间的位移δ会产生莫尔势，使费米能级附近的微带变窄，并在态密度中产生新的峰。当引入库仑相互作用后，系统形成了一个激子性的非公度CDW态。该状态的集体激发被识别为有能隙的希格斯模和无能隙的戈德斯通模（中性相子），并且相子的传播速度由位移δ和腿间隧穿强度共同决定。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使是微小的层间失配也能强烈改变层状材料中的电荷有序模式和低能集体激发。基于此，作者提出，准一维化合物HfTe3中观察到的CDW相本质上可能是激子性的。

Abstract: An incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) is a periodic modulation of charge that breaks translational symmetry incongruently with the underlying lattice. Its low-energy excitations, the phason, are collective, gapless phase fluctuations. We study a half-filled, four-band ladder model where a shift $δ=p/q$ between the legs leads to a supercell of q composite cells. The moiré potential narrows minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional peaks in the density of states, whose separation is controlled by $δ$. The inclusion of short-range Coulomb interactions leads to an excitonic incommensurate CDW state. We identify the oscillations in its amplitude with a gapped Higgs collective mode and a lowest-energy Goldstone mode, realized by long-lived neutral phasons whose propagation velocity is governed by the shift δ and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude. Our results show that even the slightest interlayer mismatches can strongly modify both charge-ordering patterns and low-energy bosonic excitations in layered materials, and suggest that the enigmatic CDW phase in the quasi-one-dimensional compound HfTe3 is excitonic in nature.

Abstract: The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened the door to a new route to high temperature superconductivity, distinct from that in cuprates and iron-based materials. Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.

Abstract: An incommensurate charge density wave is a periodic modulation of charge that breaks translational symmetry at a momentum that does not coincide with the primitive lattice vectors. Its Goldstone excitation, the phason, comprises collective gapless phase fluctuations. Aiming to unveil the mechanism behind the onset of incommensurate charge order in layered materials, we study a half-filled, four-band tight-binding model on a ladder with a relative shift $δ=p/q$ between the legs, induced by the dimerization of one of them. The shift results in a moiré supercell comprising q composite cells and a modulated inter-leg tunneling. The moiré potential compresses the leg bands into flat minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional low-energy peaks in the density of states. Including Coulomb interactions, we find an incommensurate charge-density-wave phase in which the charge modulation is out of phase between the legs. The collective excitations of this state are long-lived neutral, acoustic phasons whose speed is controlled by the moiré parameter $δ$ and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude. This model sheds light on the role of interlayer incongruities in the formation of excitonic charge-ordered phases in van der Waals and heterostructured materials.

Abstract: Phase separated manganites provide a unique platform to study the dynamics of competing electronic and structural orders in correlated systems. In $La_{0.275}Pr_{0.35}Ca_{0.375}MnO_{3}$ (LPCMO), we use temperature cycling Raman spectroscopy to uncover a previously unidentified regime of structural irreversibility, emerging from the interplay between lattice distortions and phase competition across the phase separation and charge and orbital ordering temperatures. This irreversible behavior encodes a thermal memory effect reflecting the system's history dependent energy landscape. Correlated magnetic and transport responses confirm the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom, revealing a nem form of nonequilibrium phase dynamics in mixed valence oxides. These results advance the understanding of metastability and memory phenomena in strongly correlated materials, opening pathways toward adaptive and neuromorphic functionalities in quantum materials.

Abstract: In this paper we predict that the magnetoelectric response of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets is determined by the topology of the ground state. This topological magnetoelectric response, encoded in the spin magnetoelectric polarizability and its closely related spin multipolization, occurs when the electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic insulator is described by massive 2D Dirac fermions, and is therefore native to 2D, unlike the topological magnetoelectric effect of three-dimensional topological insulators. To demonstrate the topological contribution to the (spin) magnetoelectric polarizability, we compute the magnetoelectric polarizability microscopically for two distinct minimal lattice models: a spin-orbit coupled Néel antiferromagnet and a spin-orbit-free noncollinear antiferromagnet with double-$Q$ spin order. We show that the topological origin of the revealed magnetoelectric effect can be traced back to the electromagnetic response of topological semimetals in two dimensions, and hence is ultimately governed by a strong topological invariant in one dimension. Given this dimensional hierarchy, we further consider two minimal lattice models in one dimension, both one-dimensional variants of the 2D lattice models, and show that the magnetoelectric polarizability exhibits a clear signature of nontrivial crystalline topology. Possible material realizations are discussed.

Abstract: In this paper we study magnetoelectric effects in two-dimensional magnetic bilayers and introduce the notion of a layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability. This magnetoelectric polarizability describes the magnetization response to an applied electric field perpendicular to the bilayer. As such, it represents the electric analog of the spin magnetoelectric polarizability, governing the charge polarization response to an applied Zeeman field. Starting from the orbital magnetization produced by a perpendicular displacement field, we derive a microscopic expression for the layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability and apply it to two minimal models for bilayer magnets, i.e., a buckled square lattice model and a magnetic topological insulator model. In the case of the buckled square lattice model we show that the layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability has a (quasi-)topological contribution, revealing a topological magnetoelectric response of two-dimensional antiferromagnets associated with the layer pseudospin degree of freedom.

Abstract: BaMg2Bi2 is a Dirac semimetal characterized by a simple Dirac cone crossing the Fermi level at the center of the Brillouin zone, protected by C3 rotational symmetry. Together with its Sr-based analogue SrMg2Bi2, it has been proposed as a promising candidate for a chemically driven topological switch: while SrMg2Bi2 is an insulator, BaMg2Bi2 exhibits non-trivial topological features. A detailed understanding of its electronic structure is essential to elucidate its electronic and transport properties. Previous photoemission studies confirmed the Dirac nature of BaMg2Bi2, but were limited to high photon energies, which hindered direct comparison with density functional theory calculations (DFT), due to reduced resolution and higher-frequency matrix-element modulation in that regime. In this work, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT calculations to get full insight on the valence band states, providing a comprehensive picture of the low-energy electronic structure. Our measurements reveal the presence of previously unobserved surface states. We found that they are topologically trivial, but they unlock a more comprehensive understanding of the material's behavior, reconciling previous discrepancies between experiment and theory.

*Federico Cima,Michele Papucci*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文利用重夸克有效理论（HQET）来预测特定美强子衰变的性质，为未来的实验简化了相关的理论计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为 Belle II 和 LHCb 实验即将进行的关于美强子辐射半轻子衰变的测量提供理论预测。

Method: 应用重夸克有效理论（HQET）的对称性来约束 Λ(b) → Λ(c), Λ(*)(c1) 和 B → D(*), D** 跃迁过程中的结构依赖形状因子。

Result: 研究发现，在软光子和次级软光子区域，所有的形状因子都可以完全由非辐射的Isgur-Wise函数和重强子的磁偶极矩来确定，从而大大减少了独立的形状因子数量。

Conclusion: 重夸克有效理论（HQET）为预测这些特定重强子衰变的行为提供了一个强大的框架，为 Belle II 和 LHCb 的实验分析提供了精确的理论指导。

Abstract: We derive predictions for the hadronic matrix elements of radiative semileptonic decays of beautiful hadrons within Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), relevant for future measurements at Belle II and LHCb. Our study considers Lambda(b) -> Lambda(c), Lambda(*)(c1) and B -> D(*), D** transitions. The symmetries of HQET highly constrain the number of structure-dependent form factors in all cases. In the soft and sub-leading soft regions, all the form factors are fully determined in terms of non-radiative Isgur-Wise functions and the magnetic dipole moments of the heavy hadrons. The structure of higher order corrections is also briefly discussed.

### [49] [Thermal Damping of Mass-Modulating Scalars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05188)
*Abhishek Banerjee,Ngan H. Nguyen,Erwin H. Tanin*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了早期宇宙中标量场常被忽略的热阻尼效应，推导了通用的阻尼率，并证明了其在中微子、胶子、WIMP 和轴子等粒子模型中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在宇宙学中，标量场与原始热浴的非引力耦合会产生额外的阻尼（即热阻尼），这种效应虽然可能是主导的耗散效应，但却很少被研究。

Method: 论文推导了一种近似但高度通用的热阻尼率计算方法。该方法适用于标量场通过调制热粒子（thermally populated particles）的质量而产生相互作用的情况，并扩展到标量场的振荡速度不一定比热浴平衡速率慢的场景。

Result: 基于推导出的阻尼率，论文估算了标量场分别与中微子（线性耦合）、胶子（二次耦合）和 WIMP（线性耦合）的热阻尼，并证明了该效应的重要性。此外，还估算了 QCD 轴子模型中的热阻尼率。

Conclusion: 标量场与原始热浴的相互作用产生的热阻尼是一个不可忽视的重要效应，在特定的宇宙学模型（如中微子、WIMP、QCD轴子等模型）的参数空间中，它可能是主要的耗散机制。

Abstract: The cosmological evolution of a scalar field is shaped by Hubble damping. Any non-gravitational couplings of the scalar with the primordial thermal bath generically contribute additional damping. Although rarely considered, such thermal damping could be the dominant dissipative effect. We derive approximate but highly general thermal-damping rates of scalar fields that modulate the masses of thermally populated particles. We extend previous results to cover cases of particular phenomenological interest where the scalar background oscillates sinusoidally but not necessarily slowly compared to the thermalization rates of the primordial bath. Based on these results, we estimate the thermal damping of scalars coupled to neutrinos linearly, to gluons quadratically, and to WIMPs linearly, and demonstrate its importance in certain parameter space of these models. We also estimate the thermal damping rates in models of QCD axion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CoLoRFulNNLO方法扩展到强子对撞中一类重要的过程，即色单态粒子的产生，以完成更高精度的理论计算。

Method: 作者扩展了名为CoLoRFulNNLO的完全局域减除方案。他们从已知的QCD矩阵元的红外极限公式系统地推导出了双实辐射抵消项，并确保这些抵消项可以解析积分。所有公式都被整合到公开的NNLOCAL蒙特卡洛程序中。

Result: 论文成功地为色单态产生过程提供了完整的抵消项。该构造方法效率高，产生的“抵消事件”数量少。作者通过高精度计算验证了所有红外极限，并展示了代表性结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的抵消项构成了一个独立的子集，在CoLoRFulNNLO框架下，它们也适用于更广泛的强子过程。

Abstract: We present the extension of the completely local subtraction scheme CoLoRFulNNLO to color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We provide explicit momentum mappings and the complete set of double-real counterterms required for this class of processes. The counterterms are systematically derived from the known infrared limit formulae of QCD matrix elements, and particular care has been taken to ensure their analytic integrability. The resulting construction involves a relatively small number of counter-events, preserving the locality and efficiency of the scheme. All formulae have been implemented within the publicly available NNLOCAL Monte Carlo program, and we explicitly validate all IR limits using arbitrary-precision computer algebra and present representative results. The counterterms presented here constitute a self-contained subset applicable to general hadronic processes within the CoLoRFulNNLO approach.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的可观测量——“喷注区域电荷”，并结合“1-Jettiness”事件形状，用于在深度非弹性散射（DIS）过程中研究夸克味的动力学，从而更好地区分不同味的夸克并探索强子化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更精确地分离不同味的夸克对核子结构（PDFs）的贡献，并深入探测夸克转化为强子的动力学过程（强子化），需要新的实验观测量和理论方法。

Method: 本文提出在深度非弹性散射（DIS）过程中，同时测量由“1-Jettiness”（$τ_1$）事件形状定义的喷注区域的电荷（$Q$）。研究者为此推导出了一个因子化定理，该定理引入了一个新的、普适的“带电喷注函数”，并通过模拟研究来验证该方法对夸克味动力学的敏感性。

Result: 研究表明，该方法可以有效地区分不同味的夸克：1. 根据喷注电荷对1-Jettiness分布进行划分，可以增强对初态质子中夸克味分布的分辨能力。2. 根据1-Jettiness对喷注电荷分布进行划分，可以作为探测末态强子化过程的探针。理论上，研究者推导出了一个包含新型“带电喷注函数”的因子化定理来描述该过程。

Conclusion: “1-Jettiness喷注电荷”是一个前景广阔的新物理观测量，它为研究核子结构和强子化过程提供了有效的新途径，并适用于分析现有的HERA实验数据及未来电子-离子对撞机（EIC）的实验数据。

Abstract: We propose measuring the jet electric charge of jet regions, defined within the framework of global event shapes, as a probe of quark flavor dynamics within the nucleon and the hadronization process. In particular, we consider a measurement of the jet region charge while simultaneously keeping track of the energy flow throughout the event, as characterized by the global event shape. As a concrete example, we focus on the measurement of the 1-Jettiness jet charge ($Q$), the jet charge of the jet region ($J$) defined within the framework of the 1-Jettiness global event shape ($τ_1$) for the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) process, $e^- + p \to e^- + J + X$, with unpolarized or longitudinally polarized protons. The 1-Jettiness distribution, binned according to jet charge, allows for enhanced quark flavor separation of the initial state unpolarized or polarized PDFs. On the other hand, the jet charge distribution binned by 1-Jettiness can serve as a probe of quark flavor dynamics in the final state hadronization process. We derive a factorization theorem for simultaneous measurements of $τ_1$ and $Q$ in the resummation region, $τ_1 \ll P_{J_T}$, where $P_{J_T}$ denotes the transverse momentum of the jet region. The factorization theorem contains a new universal charged jet function, generalizing the standard jet function to include a jet charge measurement. Therefore these universal functions can be extracted from a global analysis of N-jettiness and thrust at $e^+e^-$ colliders. We provide simulation studies to demonstrate the sensitivity of the 1-Jettiness jet charge observable to quark flavor dynamics in nucleon structure and explore the possibility of probing the final state hadronization process. This observable is well-suited for applications in existing HERA data and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).

### [52] [Illuminating sequential freeze-in dark matter with dark photon signal at the CERN SHiP experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05380)
*Xinyue Yin,Sibo Zheng*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种可通过暗光子媒介产生的顺序冻结暗物质模型，发现在结合遗迹丰度等限制后，未来SHiP实验可以将该模型的参数空间压缩到非常小的范围，从而对其进行有效检验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的单场冻结（single-field freeze-in）暗物质模型极难通过实验进行探测。为了寻找更具可观测性的暗物质模型，本文探讨了一种双场模型下的顺序冻结（sequential freeze-in）暗物质，并研究其在未来实验中的潜在信号。

Method: 作者构建了一个通过暗光子作为媒介的顺序冻结暗物质模型。他们首先利用暗物质遗迹丰度的观测值和暗光子的非平衡条件来约束模型的参数（暗电荷 e' 和混合参数 ε）。然后，将这些理论约束与未来SHiP实验对暗光子信号（通过质子轫致辐射过程产生）的预期排除极限进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，为了产生观测到的暗物质丰度，暗电荷被固定为 e' ~ 1.3 x 10⁻¹²，混合参数 ε 被限制在 10⁻¹¹ ≤ ε < 10⁻⁸ - 10⁻⁷.⁵ 的范围内。而SHiP实验的预期数据能够排除该参数空间的大部分区域（ε ≥ 10⁻⁸.⁵ 或 10⁻⁷.⁹），使得可行的参数空间变得非常狭窄。

Conclusion: 结合现有约束和未来SHiP实验的预期灵敏度，该顺序冻结暗物质模型的可行参数空间非常狭窄，仅剩下混合参数 ε 接近 10⁻¹¹ 的小部分区域有待进一步检验，这使得该模型具有很强的可证伪性。

Abstract: Single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves observable footprints in dark matter direct detection, collider or fixed-target experiments, which can be altered in the two-field context. In this work, we consider sequential freeze-in dark matter through signals of dark photon mediator with a mass range of $m_{A'}\sim 10^{-2}-10$ GeV covered by the proposed SHiP experiment. We show that the dark charge is fixed to be $e'\sim 1.3\times 10^{-12}$ and the mixing parameter is restricted to $10^{-11}\leq ε< 10^{-8}-10^{-7.5}$, as a result of the out-of-equilibrium condition of dark photon and the observed relic abundance of dark matter. Within this $ε$ region, the 5(15)-year data of proton bremsstrahlung process for the dark photon, assuming vector meson (dipole) dominance, excludes $ε\geq 10^{-8.5} (10^{-7.9})$ at 90\% confidence level, implying only a narrow region of $ε$ close to $\sim 10^{-11}$ left for alternative tests.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一个超对称SO(10)模型，通过非热轻子生成机制来解释宇宙的重子不对称性。研究得出了关于中微子质量、CP破坏等参数的具体预测，并发现这些预测与最新的实验数据（如JUNO实验）相符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在通过一个特定的粒子物理理论模型（超对称SO(10)模型），利用非热轻子生成机制，来解释宇宙学中的一个基本问题——观测到的重子不对称性（即物质比反物质多的原因）。

Method: 研究人员在一个最近提出的超对称SO(10)模型中，加入了通过非热轻子生成机制来解释宇宙重子不对称性的要求。他们通过数值和统计分析，对模型中的轻中微子、右手中微子的质量、CP破坏相位角等参数进行了预测，并将这些预测结果与最新的JUNO实验数据进行了比对。

Result: 1.  **中微子质量**：预测了三种标准模型中微子的质量（最轻的约为5 meV）和三种右手中微子的质量（分别约为10⁹ GeV和10¹³ GeV）。
2.  **CP破坏**：轻子部门的CP破坏相位角δ_PMNS的最佳拟合值约为235°。
3.  **其他参数**：预测了无中微子双β衰变质量参数（m_ββ ≈ 0.18 meV）、暴胀子质量和再加热温度。
4.  **实验一致性**：研究的统计分析结果与JUNO实验最新发布的反应堆中微子振荡测量结果完全一致。

Conclusion: 结合了非热轻子生成（non-thermal leptogenesis）的超对称SO(10)模型可以成功解释宇宙的重子不对称性，并为中微子性质提供了具体、可检验的预测。这些预测与当前的实验数据（如JUNO）一致，增强了该理论框架的可行性。

Abstract: We explore the leptonic sector of a recently proposed supersymmetric SO(10) model with supersymmetry breaking in the 3-10 TeV range. A new ingredient in this work is the requirement that the observed baryon asymmetry is explained via non-thermal leptogenesis, which can be realized in a large class of supersymmetric hybrid inflation models including SO(10). We provide estimates for the masses of the three Standard Model neutrinos (with the lightest mass $m_1\approx 5$ meV) as well as the three right-handed neutrinos ($M_1\approx 10^9$ GeV and $M_{2,3}\approx 10^{13}$ GeV). The best fit estimate for the leptonic CP violating parameter $δ_\mathrm{PMNS}\approx 235^\circ$, and the value of the neutrinoless double beta decay mass parameter $m_{ββ}\approx 0.18$ meV. A numerical analysis broadens the predicted range for $δ_\mathrm{PMNS}$ ($100^\circ$-$300^\circ$), but leaves largely intact the predictions for the six (light and heavy) neutrino masses and $m_{ββ}$. Our statistical analysis, which yields the likelihood-predicted ranges of the observables, is fully consistent with JUNO's newly released first measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations in the $Δm^2_{12}$-$\sin^2θ_{12}$ plane, with JUNO improving the precision by a factor of 1.6 relative to the combination of all previous measurements. The implementation of successful non-thermal leptogenesis allows us to provide estimates for the inflaton mass ($m_χ\approx 7\times 10^{9}$ GeV) and the reheating temperature ($T_\mathrm{RH}\approx 4\times 10^6$ GeV).

Abstract: We provide the first certificate of the gauge-independent bubble nucleation at the electroweak phase transition with the standard model effective field theory. Taking advantage of the thermal effective field theory framework, with the power counting $λ\sim g^3$, we rigorously demonstrate the gauge independence of the bubble nucleation rate up to two-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of relevant phase transition parameters on the gauge parameter and investigate its implications for gravitational waves generated by the electroweak phase transitions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Employing a symmetry-preserving contact-interaction formulation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we examine the identity of the $σ$ meson and its implications for the gravitational structure of hadrons. In this framework, the scalar meson emerges as the chiral partner of the pion, with both states' properties tightly connected to the mechanisms of mass generation in QCD. We find that, above a critical coupling that triggers dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, the D-terms of the constituent quark, the pion, and $σ$ saturate at fixed values $D_{q,π,σ}=-1/3,-1,-7/3$. By examining the coupling strength evolution of the D-terms, this pattern follows naturally once a dual nature for the $σ$ meson is recognized: it behaves both as a quark-antiquark composite and as a dilaton arising from spontaneous scale symmetry breaking. This unified picture yields the prediction $D_N\sim -3$ for the nucleon D-term, consistent with contemporary lattice-QCD, continuum, and dispersive studies.

Abstract: In this work, we derive the form factors and compute the branching fractions for the semitauonic decay modes, $B \to D^{(*)}\,τ\,ν_τ$, $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\,τ\,ν_τ$, $B_c \to η_c\,(J/ψ)\,τ\,ν_τ$, and $B_c \to D^{(*)}\,τ\,ν_τ$ within the \emph{Relativistic Independent Quark (RIQ) Model}, emphasizing a quark potential model based analysis of these transitions. We outline the essential elements of the model, incorporating corrections from residual interactions and center-of-mass motion, and perform a comprehensive study of the form factors across the full physical kinematic range of $q^2$. The resulting predictions demonstrate consistency and good agreement with existing theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. Motivated by recent observations of polarization observables at LHCb and Belle, we further evaluate these quantities within our framework and find results compatible with Standard Model (SM) expectations. The predictions presented here serve as theoretical input in decay channels for which Lattice QCD results remain limited, offering guidance for future experimental and Lattice efforts. Thus, semileptonic $B$ decays continue to serve as precise and discerning probes of the fundamental mechanisms governing flavor transitions in the SM.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop an inelastic Majorana dark matter model gauged by $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, featuring a complex scalar and fermions with a small Dirac mass. The model exhibits strong interactions between the dark fermion-antifermion pair and the scalar, with a large coupling generating a Majorana mass after symmetry breaking. The dark fermion splits into two nearly degenerate Majorana eigenstates, with the $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge boson $Z^\prime$ interacting via inelastic axial vector currents. The lighter Majorana serves as dark matter (DM), while the heavier may also contribute. The model predicts DM masses ranging from about 10 GeV to hundreds of GeV, with the scalar favored below 100 MeV. Strong coupling causes DM particles to mainly annihilate into two scalars, which determines the relic abundance, while thermal equilibrium with the bath occurs through $Z^\prime$ interactions. Self-interacting DM particles scatter via ladder exchange of strongly coupled light scalars, helping resolve small-scale issues. The $Z^\prime$ interacts with the muon, affecting its magnetic moment and explaining the $(g-2)_μ$ discrepancy. Effects on experiments, $N_{\text{eff}}$, and the Hubble tension from kinetic mixing between $Z^\prime$ and the photon, originating from high-energy scales, are discussed. The model details and parameter constraints used in experiments are also covered.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Global analyses of particle physics data are integral for validating and scrutinizing published results of experiments. Global fits of anomalous oscillation data which search for one or more eV-scale sterile neutrinos are particularly challenging both to evaluate and to reconcile in the global picture. Fits (especially joint ones) to oscillation data suffer from significant computational burdens, such as likelihood intractability, making traditional Markov Chain-Monte Carlo all but impossible. Given evidence both supporting and challenging beyond Standard Model physics across neutrino experiments of various baselines, energies, and detection techniques, the global search for sterile neutrinos requires additional tools in order to determine whether sterile neutrinos remain a viable solution to unexplained anomalies. Furthermore, both a Bayesian and frequentist interpretation of sterile neutrino data is needed for a complete assessment of longstanding tensions in the field. Techniques from the machine learning subfield of simulation-based inference have a natural application to such a problem. In this contribution, we illustrate some of the outstanding questions of the global picture of light sterile neutrinos by focusing on experiments searching with the disappearance of electron (anti)neutrinos, and look to posterior density estimation strategies to craft answers, including comparisons to a machine-learning-based frequentist approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the calculation of the inclusive jet function for highly energetic heavy quarks at order $\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$ using boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). This jet function describes the effect of collinear radiation emitted by energetic heavy quarks on observables dependent on the jet invariant mass $M$. In particular, we focus on the regime $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, which is relevant for boosted top quark production at high-energy colliders in the resonance region. Our results are consistent with non-Abelian exponentiation and reproduce the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions up to three loops. We also verify that the $n_\ell^2 α_s^3$ contribution, with $n_\ell$ denoting the number of light quark flavors, agrees with predictions from renormalon calculus. This calculation completes the list of ingredients required for the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution, an essential component for calibrating the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. It likewise contributes to the invariant-mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks, enabling precise mass determinations at future lepton colliders. Finally, we determine the relation between the pole and two short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$ and provide an estimate of the non-logarithmic part of the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.

Abstract: We investigate a possible dark matter origin of the high-energy nuclear-recoil excess reported by recent liquid xenon experiments, including \textnormal{XENONnT} and \textnormal{LZ}, which cannot be explained by standard elastic spin-independent WIMP scattering. Using our unified \texttt{DIAMX} framework, built on openly available data and likelihood models, we perform the first combined profile-likelihood fits to multiple WIMP-search datasets with a total exposure of 7.3~tonne $\times$ year. We investigate that two broad classes of dark matter nucleon interactions, with velocity-dependent cross-section or inelastic (endo- and exothermic) scattering, can reproduce the observed high-energy recoil spectrum, reaching local significances up to $4σ$. We further quantify the impact of $^{124}$Xe double electron capture (DEC) backgrounds, finding that variations in the poorly known DEC charge yields can shift the inferred significances from below $1σ$ to $4σ$. We point out that extending the same analysis to \textnormal{XENONnT} and \textnormal{LZ} data with recoil energies up to 300\,keV, once available, will provide a powerful test of the dark matter interpretation, since the $^{124}$Xe DEC background is expected to be negligible in this high-energy range.

Abstract: We use dijet measurements from the Large Hadron Collider to constrain ten third-generation four-quark operators in the Standard Model effective field theory. At tree level, only the five operators involving four bottom quarks are directly constrained, but renormalization group (RG) effects allow all ten operators to be probed. Our analysis includes the dominant leading-logarithmic RG contributions up to two-loop order. The resulting bounds for the first five operators are nominal stronger or comparable to current limits, while those for the remaining operators remain weak despite the inclusion of logarithmically enhanced corrections.

Abstract: In this work, we present an algorithm for the diagonalization of the Integration-by-Parts (IBP) equations. Diagonalized IBP equations are indispensable for reducing loop integrals with high numerator powers to master integrals and for solving IBP identities in closed analytic form. A prime example is provided by multivariate Mellin representations of loop amplitudes and cross sections. The extension of these methods to other multivariate recurrence relations is also discussed. As a by-product of our diagonalization procedure, we show how the IBP equations can be cast into an efficient, fully triangular form that is well suited for computer implementation.

Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions originating from vacuum fluctuations of mediator fields. Such forces inevitably arise between ordinary matter particles whenever they couple to light mediator species. Conventional computations of quantum forces rely on evaluating one-loop Feynman diagrams of the relevant scattering processes. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to compute quantum forces. Instead of relying on perturbative scattering amplitudes, we directly evaluate the quantum fluctuations of the mediator field by solving its quantized equation of motion with appropriate boundary conditions. This approach remains valid beyond the Born approximation and thus applies to regimes of strong coupling between the mediator and matter fields. In the weak-coupling limit, our results reproduce the known expressions from the Feynman diagram approach. In the strong-coupling regime, the result is modified by a factor that can suppress or enhance the effect. In contrast to classical forces, quantum forces intrinsically violate the superposition principle. Our approach may therefore offer a useful tool for probing non-perturbative effects in the infrared regime.

Abstract: Cavity-magnon-polaritons are hybrid excitations from the interaction between cavity photons and magnons, the quanta of collective spin oscillations. Along with the tunability of the magnon-photon coupling strength, fast information transfer and conversion speed are desired in hybrid devices. This can be achieved utilizing the propagating nature of spin waves with non-zero momentum for their ultra-fast time dynamics and reduced ohmic dissipation. Antiferromagnets are particularly interesting as hosts for magnons since stray-field interactions are minimized, and they support multiple modes with distinctive magnetic-field behavior across the phase diagram. CrCl3 is a van der Waals antiferromagnet having a strong easy-plane anisotropy and a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. Despite some magnetic resonance studies, the impact of magnetic reorientation of spins in CrCl3 on cavity-magnon-polariton interaction strength as a function of magnetic field remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the coupling between magnons in CrCl3 and photons in a coplanar waveguide resonator as a function of magnetic field. In particular, we find that the magnon-photon coupling strength varies nonmonotonically and distinctly with the magnetic field for both acoustic and optical magnons, enabling tuning of the coupling strength with an external magnetic field as a knob. We find the signature of spin-flop transition in two harmonics of the cavity due to a stronger dispersive coupling between optical magnons and cavity photons at lower fields. Additionally, we find standing modes formed by spin waves with nonzero momentum associated with the two hybrid magnons when the external field is applied at an angle with the crystal plane. These modes do not undergo substantial coupling with the cavity mode unlike the antiferromagnetic modes and can be used as low-loss propagation channels in hybrid devices.

Abstract: Indium antimonide (InSb) is a fundamental material for infrared radiation detectors based on interband transitions. Its narrow bandgap enables detection of infrared radiation within the $3-5 μm$ atmospheric window, while its high quantum efficiency ensures excellent sensitivity in InSb-based detectors. We propose a plasmonic structure that significantly enhances infrared absorption in an ultrathin InSb film. The resonant characteristics of this plasmonic enhancement effect could serve as a foundation for developing highly sensitive multi-color detectors.

Abstract: The concept of custodial symmetry, a residual symmetry that protects physical observables from large quantum corrections, has been a cornerstone of high-energy physics, but its experimental observation has remained unexplored. Building on recent theoretical work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 097701 (2022)], we report the first experimental observation of classical analog of custodial chiral symmetry in a memristive Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. We provide direct experimental evidence for custodial symmetry through the measurement of the correction to the Lagrangian. This Lagrangian correction, which mimics a mass term in field theory, vanishes smoothly as the perturbation is reduced. We also demonstrate that topological edge states in the memristive SSH circuit remain localized at the boundary, protected by custodial chiral symmetry. This work opens new avenues for emulating field-theoretic symmetries and nonlinear dynamics in memristive platforms.

Abstract: Ultra low voltage operation of Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has been demonstrated in recent years as high radiance with minimal power consumption is a desired feature. However, the light output at such conditions from PeLEDs is typically very low, and the maximum in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) are achieved at large biases with significant power consumption. Here, we explore the possibility of achieving maximums in EQE and ECE at sub band gap voltages for PeLEDs. Our analysis consistently interprets otherwise scattered experimental data from literature, identifies the limits for low voltage operation, and elucidates optimization routes for sub band gap high radiance operation of PeLEDs.

Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$-wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We obtain various analytic formulas based on the two-band Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aspires to overcome the intrinsic inefficiencies of von Neumann architectures by co-locating memory and computation in physical devices that emulate biological neurons and synapses. Memristive materials stand at the core of this paradigm, enabling non-volatile, history-dependent electronic responses. While inorganic oxides currently dominate the field, molecular and polymeric systems can offer untapped advantages in terms of chemical tunability, structural flexibility, low-cost processing, and biocompatibility. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a theoretical framework able to rationalize how molecular structure translates into memristive function. Here, a multiscale computational perspective is presented, outlining how quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics, among other approaches, can be integrated into a coherent methodology to design next-generation organic memristors. Three mechanisms, ionic migration, redox-driven switching, and conduction interplay in chiral molecules are examined as representative routes toward molecular neuromorphic hardware. The opportunities and challenges associated with each mechanism are discussed, together with a view on how a theoretically guided roadmap can accelerate the emergence of chemically engineered synaptic materials.

Abstract: Superconducting nanodevices such as qubits, resonators, and photodetectors, have revolutionized our capabilities for probing and controlling quantum phenomena. Nonequilibrium quasiparticles, which are broken Cooper pairs that cause decoherence and energy loss, can limit their performance. The number of these quasiparticles is often tens of orders of magnitude greater than would be present in thermal equilibrium. Background radiation has been shown to excite quasiparticles, but quasiparticles are observed even when the devices are carefully shielded. Here we show that the high-frequency components of 1/f noise can excite quasiparticle pairs and that this mechanism is consistent with previously unexplained experimental results. We also propose new experiments that exploit this quasiparticle excitation mechanism to non-invasively characterize high-frequency charge noise as well as the locations and nature of the defects producing the noise. The proposed experiments would also investigate how this noise changes as the defects that give rise to it evolve towards thermal equilibrium.

Abstract: The Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a well-known mechanism for the spin-charge interconversion via the inverse and direct spin galvanic effects. The lack of a full inversion symmetry allows the coupling of the charge current and spin density. In this paper we investigate this phenomenon when the in-plane rotational symmetry is lowered to the $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ symmetry groups, whereby the electron spectrum becomes anisotropic. We find that in the $C_{2v}$ case, depending on the ratio between the Rashba SOC strengths along the principal axes, the non-equilibrium spin density deviates notably from the $90^o$ degrees rotation, with respect to the applied electric field, familiar in the isotropic case. In the $C_{3v}$ case, when a warping cubic-in-momentum term is present, whereas the standard $90^o$ degrees rotation of the spin density remains, the spin-charge interconversion depends on the intensity of the warping itself. The microscopic theory takes into account disorder including vertex corrections, both via the diagrammatic implementation of the Kubo formula and via the quantum kinetic theory. We show that vertex corrections are crucial to capture the details of the inverse spin galvanic effect in contrast to previous treatments based on the constant broadening approximation.

Abstract: We show theoretically that weak quantum fluctuations induced by a non-symmetric electromagnetic environment may lead to a quantized transconductance of a multi-terminal quantum contact rather than to a blockade of transport in the contact.

Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.

Abstract: Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors critically influence current flow and coherence, thereby imposing fundamental limits on superconducting quantum technologies. Quantum circuits employ superconducting elements at micro- and mesoscopic scales, where individual vortices can significantly impact device performance, necessitating investigation of vortex entry, motion, and pinning in these constrained geometries. Cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements offer a promising route to the single-photon strong-coupling regime and enable highly sensitive probing of the mechanical degree of freedom under elevated magnetic fields. Here, we exploit this platform to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level. We observe discrete jumps of the mechanical resonance frequency attributable to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and allowing quantitative extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures are superimposed on a smooth power-law background characteristic of the collective Campbell-regime of vortex elasticity. Our results establish optomechanics-inspired sensing as a powerful method for exploring fundamental superconducting properties and identifying decoherence pathways in quantum circuits. Beyond advancing vortex physics, this work opens new opportunities for integrating mechanical sensing into superconducting device architectures, bridging condensed matter physics and quantum information science.
