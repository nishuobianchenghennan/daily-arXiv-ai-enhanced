For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the\npairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role. We here\ndemonstrate that quantum geometry can also be essential for the disorder\nsensitivity of a superconductor, in particular when time-reversal symmetry is\nbroken in the normal-state Bloch Hamiltonian. We derive a general expression\nfor the behavior of the critical temperature $T_c$ involving weighted\n(anti-)commutators of the superconducting order parameter and impurity matrix\nelements, which includes both wave-function effects and kinetic pair breaking\ndue to broken time-reversal symmetry in the dispersion. We analyze how the\nformer effects lead to \"quantum geometric pair breaking\", where any\nsuperconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities,\nand formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle\nWannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities\ncan also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic\nbehavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration.

The implemented spin-scaling exchange-correlation\n(ssxc) approach allowed to modify the magnetic moment and ferromagnetic phase\nenergetics using a single scaling parameter, thereby yielding an adjustment of\nthe critical pressure ($p_c$) to its experimental value. The ssxc scheme\nresulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up\nchannel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the\nexperimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon\ndispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of\nthe pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic\nbranch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT\ncalculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish\nsignificantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend\nparallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment. A comparative\nanalysis of the electronic joint density of states with the phonon linewidths\nrevealed that the momentum dependence of linewidths around the $R$-point\nclosely follow the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon matrix elements.\nThis indicates that the correlation between magnetic moment and linewidths\nunder applied pressure originates from the electron-phonon matrix elements,\npresenting a distinct scenario compared to other B20 family members, where\nnesting plays a more dominating role."}

The energetic early universe provides an exciting\nopportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with\nhigh-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK)\ngravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs.

Many of these non-linear responses owe their\norigin to the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which, like the Berry curvature\n(monopole), is also an electronic band structure effect, but is routinely\nstrongly constrained by crystalline symmetries. Here, we propose\nnon-centrosymmetric transition metal oxide heterostructures as promising\nplatforms for realizing and tuning BCD-induced non-linear Hall effects.\nSpecifically, we investigate superlattices of the form\n$(\\mathrm{Ba(Os,Ir)}\\mathrm{O}_3)_n/(\\mathrm{BaTiO}_3)_4$ ($n{=}1, 2$),\ncomprising metallic perovskite layers ($\\mathrm{BaOsO_3}$ or\n$\\mathrm{BaIrO_3}$) sandwiched between insulating ferroelectric\n$\\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO). The ferroelectric distortion in BTO breaks inversion\nsymmetry of the superlattice, giving rise to a finite BCD with two\nsymmetry-allowed components of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Our\nfirst-principles calculations demonstrate that the magnitude of the BCD -- and\nconsequently the nonlinear Hall response -- can be effectively tuned by varying\nthe number of metallic layers or the choice of the B-site cation in these\n$\\mathrm{ABO_3}$ perovskites. Since Rashba splitting and ferroelectric\ndistortion in these systems are readily controllable via an external electric\nfield or strain, the non-linear Hall response in these materials can be\ndirectly engineered.

The ssxc scheme\nresulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up\nchannel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the\nexperimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon\ndispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of\nthe pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic\nbranch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT\ncalculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish\nsignificantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend\nparallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment.
