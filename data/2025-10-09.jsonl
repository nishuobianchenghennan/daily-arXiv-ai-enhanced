Comments welcome!", "summary": "Jet substructure provides one of the most exciting new approaches for\nsearching for physics in and beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Modern jet substructure searches are often performed with Neural\nNetwork (NN) taggers which study the jets' radiation distributions in great\ndetail, far beyond what is theoretically described by parton shower generators.\nWhile this represents a great opportunity, as NNs look deeper into the\nstructure of jets they become increasingly sensitive both to perturbative and\nnon-perturbative theoretical uncertainties. It is therefore important to be\nable to control which aspects of both regimes the networks focus on, and to\ndevelop techniques for quantifying these uncertainties. In this paper we take\ntwo steps in this direction: First, we introduce EnFNs, a generalization of the\nEnergy Flow Networks (EFNs) which directly probes higher point correlations in\njets, as motivated by recent advances in the study of energy correlators.\nSecond, we introduce a number of techniques to quantify and visualize their\nrobustness to non-perturbative corrections. We highlight the importance of such\nconsiderations in a toy study incorporating systematics into a search, and\nmaximizing for the network's discovery significance, as opposed to absolute\ntagging performance. We hope this study continues the interest in understanding\nthe role QCD systematics play in Machine Learning applications and opens the\ndoor to a better interplay between theory and experiment in HEP."}

Here we present an alternative\nperspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free\nmany-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES\ncan be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a\nlong-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called\nspinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths\nare accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the\nspectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary.

In both\nsystems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\\text{H}} = L_{0}=\n\\pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the\nHall Lorenz ratio $L_{\\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity\n$\\kappa_{\\mu\\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ divided by\ntemperature.
