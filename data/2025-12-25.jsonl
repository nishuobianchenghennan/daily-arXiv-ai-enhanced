Starting from the most general theory at the electroweak scale, which allows for CP-violating interactions suppressed by inverse powers of an ultraviolet scale $Λ$, we derive the corresponding low-energy effective theory valid below the GeV scale. Within this framework, we systematically expand the effective couplings of $φ$ to on-shell photons in powers of small parameters. Working at the one-loop level, we retain terms at first order in $1/Λ$. We incorporate both isospin-breaking effects and $η$-$η'$ mixing, and provide explicit expressions for the couplings up to first order in $m_φ^2/m_η^2$ and $m_π^2/m_η^2$. As applications, we compute the decay rate of $φ$ into two photons and illustrate our results in several physically motivated scenarios."}

These models have unique collider signals associated with the confining flux strings, which cannot break due to the large mass of the quirks. Our work shows that in these models $T_\\text{RH} \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV for the entire `quirky' parameter space where the effects of the flux string are important. These bounds are in tension with most models of baryogenesis, showing that the discovery of quirks at colliders can have far-reaching implications for cosmology. The bounds arise because the irreducible relic abundance of glueballs from UV freeze-in, combined with their long lifetimes, leads to constraints from the disruption of BBN, distortions of the CMB, excess $γ$-rays, an over-abundance of self-interacting dark matter, and contributions to $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$. The glueball freeze-in abundance has a strong dependence on $T_\\text{RH}$, making the bounds relatively insensitive to strong interaction uncertainties. The bounds are robust to the SM quantum numbers of the quirks and the presence of Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. In non-minimal extensions of the model where the glueballs can decay to an additional dark sector, the bounds remain for models where the flux string has a macroscopic length at colliders. We also show that for quirk masses above $\\sim 10$ TeV, the dark glueballs can be the dominant component of dark matter. This work illustrates a striking connection between quirky collider signals and cosmological probes of new physics, strengthening the case for targeted quirk searches at colliders."}

Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials."}

For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $β$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\\cal T}_{GNR}(\\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage."}

Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials."}

Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$."}

Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry.

The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x.

Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices."}

Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms."}

Physical characterizations reveal enhanced electron correlations evidenced by a Sommerfeld coefficient substantially larger than band calculations and pressure-induced deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior. Magnetic measurements show short-range antiferromagnetic correlations developing around 460 K, followed by long-range magnetic ordering at 14 K. Additionally, subtle anomalies at 378 K suggest possible electronic ordering. First-principles calculations reveal nearly-flat Cr-3d bands near the Fermi level and predict a striped antiferromagnetic ground state. This work demonstrates how electron count variation in the CeCr$_2$Si$_2$C-type structure family leads to magnetic ordering in LaCr$_2$Ge$_2$N, contrasting with the paramagnetic behavior of LnCr$_2$Si$_2$C compounds."}

Working exclusively within the low-energy chiral effective theory, we derive bounds that are independent of the details of the dark matter interactions in the UV. Dark matter that interacts only hadronically at leading order also inevitably interacts with photons or electrons at next-to-leading-order. We show that these electromagnetic interactions lead to strong constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis and over-production of dark matter via freeze-in at low temperatures, while the leading-order hadronic couplings face stringent constraints from meson decays. Combining these constraints, we rule out both spin-independent and spin-dependent dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-sections $\\gtrsim 10^{-36}\\,{\\rm cm}^2$ for dark matter masses in the keV - 100 MeV range.

They, however, simulate very fast deposition rates, to reduce computational costs. Therefore, they are more akin to surface sputtering, leading to abnormal growth effects, including thick amorphous layers and large defect densities. A recently developed method, called the minimum energy atomic deposition (MEAD), tries to overcome this problem by depositing the atoms directly at the minimum energy positions, increasing the time scale.\n  We apply the MEAD method to simulate SiC crystal growth on stepped C-terminated 4H substrates with 4° and 8° off-cut angle. We explore relevant calculations settings, such as amount of equilibration steps between depositions and influence of simulation cell sizes and bench mark different interatomic potentials. The carefully calibrated methodology is able to replicate the stable step-flow growth, which was so far not possible using conventional MD simulations. Furthermore, the simulated crystals are evaluated in terms of their dislocations, surface roughness and atom mobility.

Here, we report on the intentional epitaxial growth and semiconductor properties of NiGa2O4 spinel layers that form at Ga2O3/NiO interfaces used in high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. Cubic spinel NiGa2O4 films of 10-50 nm thicknesses and low surface roughness (~ 2 nm) were grown using pulsed laser deposition at a substrate temperatures in the 300-900 °C range on α-Al2O3 and β-Ga2O3 substrates of different orientation.

The valence band offset between NiGa2O4 and β-Ga2O3 is determined to be 1.8 eV. The NiGa2O4-based p-n heterojunction devices on Ga2O3 (001) substrates exhibit a rectification ratio of 10^8 (for +/-2V) and a turn-on voltage of 1.4 V, maintaining diode behavior up to 600 °C.

We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, Néel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including Néel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit.

In this framework, the dynamical description of a relativistic fluid requires a new macroscopic variable, the spin density, which is associated with a spin tensor. This tensor, defined as the expectation value of a rank-3 tensor operator in quantum field theory, contributes to the system's total angular momentum. The need for such a theory is motivated by recent measurements of spin polarization of hadrons produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n  Two distinct formulation methods are employed. The first is grounded in covariant thermodynamics and extends the conventional Navier-Stokes and Müller-Israel-Stewart theories of relativistic hydrodynamics by incorporating a spin tensor. The second is based on principles of relativistic quantum statistical mechanics, building upon and generalizing the foundational Zubarev approach. Both formulations aim to construct a closed system of evolution equations for the macroscopic variables and, via an entropy-current analysis, to identify the dissipative currents and their associated transport coefficients.\n  These two approaches provide different perspectives for future applications focused on spin polarization measurements. Beyond its phenomenological relevance, the theory also opens several avenues for further theoretical developments. These include the verification of the thermodynamic relations employed in the first formulation method using microscopic frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding of the emerging transport coefficients - particularly those associated with the spin tensor - through microscopic modeling or data-driven parameter extraction."}

Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices."}

Our analysis reveals pronounced thermal hysteresis in phonon self-energy parameters and dynamic Raman susceptibility, confirming the first-order nature of the antipolar transition near TC1 ~ 145 K and a second-order transition near TC2 ~ 190 K. Low-frequency modes associated with Cu+ and Cr3+ ions exhibit softening and anomalous linewidth behaviour, in particular phonon mode P2 (~ 37 cm-1) showing non-monotonic temperature dependence and intensity enhancement near 60 K suggesting persistent off-centre Cu+ dynamics in the quasi-antipolar phase. The coexistence and coupling of soft phonon modes and central peaks indicate a crossover from displacive to order-disorder type transition mechanisms. Additionally, phonon anomalies below the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) reflect spin-phonon coupling, linking lattice vibrations to long-range magnetic correlations.

The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion."}

In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT."}

Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 <= N <= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N < 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N > 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 <= N <= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems."}

At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem.

In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics."}

Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$.

Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise."}

Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer.

Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($>$ 1 mA/$μ$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics."}

The nematic and magnetic phases are strongly intertwined under applied pressure in FeSe, however, the additional isoelectronic substitution of sulphur offers an elegant way to separate them. Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$."}
