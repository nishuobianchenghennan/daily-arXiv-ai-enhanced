Here we take current, rather than magnetic field, as the external drive. We image the magnetic field of a high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor strip after cooling. We confirm that even in zero magnetic field, current-biased cooling nucleates vortices within the strip. With a small external magnetic field, the distribution is polarized opposite to the Lorentz-force direction. These behaviors follow from the self-consistent relation between current and local field in steady flux flow. Our findings show that current history is encoded as vortices. This reveals self-field effects that influence dc measurements and glassy transitions under drive."}

Anisotropy is one such manifestation, often linked to spatially modulated electronic states and unconventional pairing mechanisms. Pronounced in plane anisotropy recently reported at KTaO3 based oxide interfaces points to the emergence of a stripe order in superconducting phase, yet its microscopic origin and formation pathway remain unresolved. Here, we show that controlled interfacial disorder in MgO/KTaO3(111) heterostructures drives a percolative evolution from localized Cooper-pair islands to superconducting puddles and eventually to stripes. The extracted stripe width matches the spin precession length, suggesting a self organized modulation governed by spin orbit coupling and lattice-symmetry breaking.

In this paper, we report the first demonstration of α-Ta/insulating TaN/a-Ta superconductor/insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions fabricated on 300 mm wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. The junctions were fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates using standard processes available at 300 mm scale, including 193 nm optical lithography, ALD of TaN in a cluster tool, and chemical mechanical planarization to enable highly planar interfaces. Junction areas ranging from 0.03 um2 to 9 um2 with ALD TaN thickness between 2 nm and 7 nm were characterized. A critical current density of 76 uA/um2 was observed in junctions using 4 nm ALD TaN in the tunnel barrier. The dependence of Jc on ALD TaN layer thickness is analyzed, and the influence of junction geometry, packaging, and temperature on I-V characteristics is discussed. Junctions were retested after a period of 4 months to quantify junction aging. The potential of this novel material system and a 300 mm superconducting junction process flow to fabricate thermally and environmentally stable junctions is discussed.

The scheme works in the frequency domain (using phasors) and couples the oscillatory Stokes equation with rigid or flexible structures, modeled by viscoelastic networks of immersed boundary kernels. The fluid-structure coupling can be solved by two routes. One route calculates the hydrodynamic mobility matrix required to solve the equation for the structure deformation rate in matrix form. The second route iteratively solves the coupled fluid-structure equations: fluid-induced forces on the structures create a tension field which is then transferred to the fluid, until convergence. The resulting fixed-point problem is solved iteratively using the Anderson acceleration method. The mobility route is optimal when dealing with one or few structures, while the iterative scheme is preferred for denser dispersions. In any case, the flow resulting from the body forces is solved by a recently developed scheme [J. Fluid. Mech. 1010 A57, 2025] which is spectral in space and time and deals with doubly periodic open domains (either free-space or wall-bounded) where meshing is restricted to the region of interest around the structures. We test the present scheme in two applied contexts: quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) of spheres, suspended, adsorbed or tethered to viscoelastic linkers; and force spectroscopy (via atomic force microscopy) reproducing the power spectra of vibrating microparticles near a solid boundary.

The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy around surface defects further confirms that QWS of Dirac electrons in topological insulators remains robust against defect scattering. This work paves the way for exploring diverse quantum phenomena and device applications through quantum confinement, surface-state engineering, and tunable topological phases."}

Namely, TMDs show an anomalous, upward-sloping zeroth LL in the valence band and an asymmetric orbital magnetization between electron and hole bands. In this paper, we employ a continuum three-band model to derive analytic constraints on the LL spectrum of the $K$ and $K'$ valleys at weak magnetic fields. This model highlights the cyclic structure of the LL spectrum inherited from $C_3$ symmetry, providing both analytical tractability and an accurate description of the band geometry in the low energy approximation of the valleys. We compare our results against numerical calculations using the three-band tight-binding model of Ref.[1] and a distorted kagome lattice model. We find that the Landau levels of the $K$ and $K'$ valleys show a cyclic structure which explains their anomalous slope and magnetization asymmetry. This asymmetry can be traced to the topological obstruction of TMD semiconductors. We further analyze the impact of disorder, finding that the zeroth LL exhibits partial robustness against certain off-diagonal perturbations, in contrast to the exact index-theorem protection of massive Dirac particles. Our results establish a direct link between orbital structure, band topology, and magnetic response in TMDs."}

In this work, we critically examine the mechanisms for neutron stars to acquire enough hidden-sector particles with requisite couplings to furnish a detectable signature from dark electromagnetism. We demonstrate that the repulsive nature of vector forces imposes stringent constraints on any putative particle physics model or astrophysical environment which could give rise to such gravitational signatures.

Here we consider the localizable class CI in 3D, and numerically investigate the stability of surface states. We demonstrate that surface states of a bulk class-CI topological lattice model are fragile in that they can be Anderson localized by the combination of weak quenched randomness and hybridization with an additional trivial 2D band (a trivializing proximity effect, TPE). With the TPE, stronger disorder is more destructive to the surface states of the bulk lattice model. By contrast, without additional bands the surface states remain extended, exhibiting robust spectrum-wide quantum criticality. We also investigate the fragility of surface states in effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene. Although the continuum models exhibit signs of Anderson localization near gap edges for weak disorder, stronger disorder instead appears to heal the surface, restoring criticality whilst filling in spectral energy gaps. Our results provide further evidence that effective continuum field theories fail to capture key aspects of surface-state physics in localizable topological phases."}

Homoepitaxial 010 beta-Ga2O3 films were implanted with Ge to form 50 and 100 nm box concentration of 3*10^19 cm^-3 and 5*10^19 cm^-3, with damage ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 displacement per atom. For lower damage implants, optimized anneals in ultrahigh purity N2 at 950-1000 C for 5-10 minutes resulted in Rs of 600-700 omega/sqr, mobilities of 60-70 cm^2/Vs, and Ge activation of up to 40%. For higher damage implants, activation dropped to 23% with similar mobilities. Ge diffusion, measured by second ion mass spectrometry, showed formation of a Ge \"clustering peak\" with a concentration exceeding the initial implant following anneals in N2 or O2 at 950-1000 C. Beyond this peak, minimal Ge diffusion occurred for N2 anneals at 950 C, but at 1050 C non-Fickian diffusion extended to >200 nm. Electrical activation data suggests that clustered Ge is electrically inactive. To understand Ge clustering, several samples were characterized by synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Second-phase precipitates were observed in as-implanted samples which then fully dissoved after furnace annealing in N2 at 1050 C. Diffraction peaks suggest these implant-induced precipitates may be related to a high pressure Pa-3 phase of GeO2, and may evolve during anneals to explain the Ge clustering.

If black holes form and evaporate within the cooling timescale of the neutron star, periodic episodes of black hole evaporation could impart a steady-state stellar luminosity, providing a source of heat additional to the kinetic energy of dark matter during capture.

Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry.

Despite their utility, an atomic basis that is adaptable, strictly localized on atomic centers, and enables accurate tight-binding interpolation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals (COGITO), a framework that constructs an optimal atomic orbital basis by identifying and resolving key mathematical obstacles inherent to nonorthogonal bases--particularly uncontrolled orbital mixing, and the fixed-overlap constraint between orbitals. We demonstrate that COGITO enables tight-binding models as accurate as MLWF-based approaches, while preserving the ability of tight-binding parameters to represent the projected atomic basis--an essential feature lost in schemes that enforce orbital orthogonality or maximal localization. By creating accurate and chemically interpretable models of electronic structure, COGITO reveals the orbital-resolved covalent bonds and charge transfer that is encoded in the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of DFT. Our method thus offers a powerful tool for any physics- or chemistry-based application that relies on a faithful description of local electronic structure."}

While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models."}

The unique electronic properties of graphene, combined with the resonant characteristics of SPPs, create a synergistic effect that amplifies the nonlinear optical signals. This enhancement is attributed to the strong field confinement and the resonant nature of SPPs, which effectively increase the interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer.

We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities.

Here, we develop a gauge-invariant first-principles framework for CD including exciton effects based on full minimal coupling (FMC) within the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism. In contrast to standard multipole expansion and sum-over-states (SOS) approaches, which require careful gauge-fixing, converge slowly, and suffer origin ambiguities, FMC evaluates optical matrix elements directly at finite photon wavevector, naturally including intraband and near-degenerate transitions while placing electric-dipole (ED), magnetic-dipole (MD), and electric-quadrupole (EQ) contributions on equal footing. Applied to two prototypical two-dimensional chiral hybrid perovskites, (S-NEA)2PbBr4 and (S-MBA)2PbI4, our calculations reveal that MD and EQ channels contribute equally to the CD signal. Crucially, intraband and quasi-degenerate transitions only captured within FMC can significantly modify CD spectra, especially in systems with dense band degeneracies. The FMC framework, therefore, offers a computationally efficient and numerically robust way for predicting chiral optoelectronic phenomena in complex solids."}

At first sight, this might appear of little practical use, as non-relativistic scattering through pseudo-scalar interactions is momentum-suppressed and spin-dependent, resulting in scattering rates below any experimental sensitivity. We show that the scattering rate can be drastically enhanced in two ways. First, light ALPs with masses below the typical momentum transfer at direct detection experiments lift the momentum suppression by acting as essentially massless mediators. Second, ALP exchange through loops induces coherent spin-independent scattering. If the ALP has flavor-changing couplings to up-type quarks, loop-induced scattering receives an extra strong enhancement by the top-quark mass. We deduce that, contrary to common lore, XENONnT and PandaX-4T are already sensitive to ALP-mediated dark matter-nucleon scattering. The next generation of direct detection experiments will probe far into the parameter space of the ALP effective theory, potentially exceeding the sensitivity of collider searches."}

This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence.

Simultaneously, interlayer hybridization across the MI-bulk boundary is strongly suppressed, leading to electronic isolation. In twisted double bilayer MoTe2, this stratification gives rise to coexisting honeycomb and triangular lattice motifs in the frontier valence bands. We further demonstrate that twist angle and weak gating can create energy shift of bands belonging to the two motifs, producing Chern band reordering and nonlinear electric polarization with modest hole doping. Our approach allows efficient simulation of multilayer moire systems and reveals structural-electronic separation phenomena absent in bilayer systems."}

At such temperatures, the irreducible ultraviolet (UV) freeze in production of DM through graviton exchange becomes important and must be combined with the infrared (IR) freeze in yield mediated by the dark photon. As long as gravitationally produced DM does not equilibrate through annihilation into dark photons and the subsequent formation of a dark thermal bath, it retains information about the reheating phase. Including this gravitational contribution relaxes the required DM and SM portal coupling and allows smaller values than those that would match the observed relic abundance through IR freeze in alone.

Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions.

Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH.

We simulate a realistic Si/SiGe spin qubit device as an illustration, and discuss electron-phonon interactions in the two bands k.p model. Beyond spin qubits, this model enables efficient simulations of SiGe heterostructure devices where spin and valley physics are relevant."}

Previous time-resolved spectroscopic studies on a thin GaP nucleation layer discovered a discrete electronic state and a phonon mode at 2 THz, both localized at the heterointerface and enhanced resonantly at pump photon energy of 1.4~eV. Here we investigate the influence of the high-temperature overgrowth on the interface electronic state and the 2-THz phonon mode. We find that the high-temperature overgrowth quenches the 1.4-eV resonances in the electronic transition and in the phonon amplitude, yet the 2-THz phonon mode is still observed after the overgrowth. Furthermore, the optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is qualitatively different between before and after the overgrowth. Our observations imply that the phonon frequency is defined by robust local atomic bondings such as Ga-Si at the heterointerface. The phonon amplitude, on the other hand, is determined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition, which is dominated by the discrete state before the overgrowth and by charge transfer between the valence bands of the two semiconductors after the overgrowth."}

However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that water adsorption greatly reduces bandgap of zigzag oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs).

Field effect transistors were successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of zBNNRs with adsorbates of water could be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements were taken to determine the optical bandgap in zBNNR. Wider zBNNRs exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17 eV. This study yields fundamental insights in new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride."}

The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries.

Herein, we theoretically investigate PSHE modulated by LL transitions δn = n'-n =-2, 0, +2 (where n and n' indicate the LL indexes of valence and conduction bands, respectively) in monolayer WTe2. Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle Θ because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of Θ with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55>->|n'=57>. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the Θ is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |Θ| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems."}

These combined processes result in a simultaneous thermal enhancement and blueshift of the Mn2+ emission band associated with the 4T1 -> 6A1 electronic transition. Consequently, the emission intensity recorded in the G channel increases with temperature, while the luminescence signals detected in the B channel exhibit a corresponding decrease.

Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations.

However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moiré unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moiré of a 2$^{\\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moiré-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moiré excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures."}

Here we report in situ x-ray diffraction measurements of Fe, Fe + 4.5 FeO (atomic proportion), and Fe2O3 melts at 177-438 GPa, achieved using laser-driven shock compression at an x-ray free-electron laser. The melts exhibit Fe-O coordination numbers between 4.0(0.4) and 4.5(0.4), indicating predominantly four-fold coordination environments. These coordination states are significantly smaller than those of Fe-bearing lower-mantle phases such as bridgmanite and ferropericlase. Shorter Fe-Fe interatomic distances in compressed iron oxide melts drive the denser packing relative to ambient melts, while the structural differences between Fe + 4.5 FeO and Fe2O3 melts under shock indicate that the oxidation state modulates oxygen solubility in liquid Fe. At around 177 GPa (380 km below the core-mantle boundary), Fe2O3 melts exhibit higher Fe-O coordination, suggesting that local variations in oxygen content could contribute to the stratification in the uppermost outer-core inferred from seismological and geomagnetic observations."}

We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $δ_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $δ_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$ν$SB proposal, substantially enhances $δ_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum."}

Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals."}

However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \\to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \\ll M_s \\sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\\bar K$ molecule state at low energies.

A key missing element has been the ability to optically access dark excitons - optically forbidden but functionally crucial states that shape energy flow, coherence, and spin dynamics in quantum materials. Here we show that exciton-magnon coupling provides an optical gateway to dark excitons in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr. Broadband femtosecond reflectivity reveals a dark exciton at 1.46 eV that is entirely absent in static optical spectra but becomes visible through its coherent hybridization with a GHz magnon. High-photon-energy excitation further allows active control of the hybrid dispersion, enabling strong renormalization and selective enhancement of exciton-magnon interactions. These results establish a general mechanism by which magnetic order renders dark excitons optically addressable, opening a pathway toward engineered hybrid spin-exciton platforms for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction."}

Applying this to multilayer twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2), we identify a structural and electronic stratification: the two moire interface (MI) layers retain substantial lattice reconstruction even in thick multilayers, while outer bulk like layers show rapidly attenuated distortions.Surprisingly, this stratification becomes strongest not in the ultra-small twist angle regime (<~1°), where in plane domain formation is well known, but rather at intermediate angles (2-5°). Simultaneously, interlayer hybridization across the MI-bulk boundary is strongly suppressed, leading to electronic isolation. In twisted double bilayer MoTe2, this stratification gives rise to coexisting honeycomb and triangular lattice motifs in the frontier valence bands. We further demonstrate that twist angle and weak gating can create energy shift of bands belonging to the two motifs, producing Chern band reordering and nonlinear electric polarization with modest hole doping. Our approach allows efficient simulation of multilayer moire systems and reveals structural-electronic separation phenomena absent in bilayer systems."}

By probing the intricate interplay between system parameters and frictional behavior, scientists seek to unveil the underlying mechanisms that enable prediction and control of friction - an essential step toward carbon neutrality. Yet, reproducing frictional behavior in experiments is notoriously difficult. Here, we show that this challenge stems from the extreme sensitivity of tribological systems to tiny variations, e.g. in surface topography, typically presumed well- controlled. Even after meticulous surface preparation to semiconductor-industry standards and curtailing misalignment-induced oscillations, subtle variations remain and interact. In turn, such minute initial differences lead to statistically significant variations in friction and wear, giving rise to system-level chaotic behavior. Yet, by leveraging mid-scale features of surface topography and misalignment-induced oscillations - information often filtered out or overlooked - we established a model that accurately predicts high-friction regions under vastly different lubrication scenarios, with its performance further enhanced by machine learning."}

It has been predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator-metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that water adsorption greatly reduces bandgap of zigzag oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water adsorbed beside the BNNR induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2 V/nm thereby reducing its bandgap. Field effect transistors were successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of zBNNRs with adsorbates of water could be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements were taken to determine the optical bandgap in zBNNR. Wider zBNNRs exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17 eV.

We extend a hybrid multiscale framework that couples cluster dynamics (Xolotl) with a phase-field model (MARMOT) to large 3D polycrystals with heterogeneous GB and surface diffusion and evolving GB networks. We simulate 10- and 100-grain UO$_2$ microstructures at 1200 and 1600 K, with and without a FS, to interrogate bubble growth, coalescence, GB/TJ coverage, gas arrival at interfaces, and fission gas release (FGR). At 1200 K, both GB mobility and gas transport are low, yielding negligible bubble and GB evolution. At 1600 K, intergranular bubbles rapidly become lenticular and coalesce into networks while unpinned GBs migrate; fewer initial bubbles reduce coalescence but enhance GB migration due to less pinning and produce spikes in interfacial gas arrival rate due to GB sweeping. Bubble density versus mean projected area agrees with White's (2004) coalescence trend and remains on the left side of the analytical curve, in contrast to several prior simulations, likely due to the inclusion of GB migration. In domains with a FS, early release is rapid and bubbles near the FS collapse to form a denuded zone, suppressing local network connectivity; GB coverage rises and approaches but does not exceed 50%. TJ coverage remains low without preferential nucleation at TJs.

Specifically, we show that peaks in $κ(ν)$ arise from the frequency nesting of modes with identical wave vectors. Applying this approach to CuCl, we identify clear signatures of coherent transport in its dynamical lattice thermal conductivity. We revisit the interpretation of thermoreflectance experiments and argue that the conventional understanding breaks down in strongly anharmonic crystals, alloys, and amorphous materials.

The Σ7(0001) grain boundary exhibits weakening, with fracture occurring preferentially along path I. Segregation energy calculations show that Si, Cu, Cr, Mo and Fe prefer interstitial sites, while others occupy substitutional ones. Si, Al, Zn, Cu, Mg and Fe stabilize the boundary, while Mo, Fe, Si, Cr, Cu, Nb and Ti strengthen it, with Si offering the most balanced improvement. Co-segregation studies reveal that Si induces the enrichment of other solutes at the boundary, promoting synergistic stabilization and turning embrittling elements (Al, Mg, Zn, Zr) into strengthening agents. Electronic structure analysis shows that Si-Y covalent bonds enhance electron localization, and Si+Mg co-segregation optimizes electronic distribution through metallic-covalent cooperation, significantly improving fracture resistance.

The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands.

Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry. Both systems exhibit distinctive features across a broad range of temperatures and parameters. Therefore, our prediction of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly testable in present-day magnonic experiments, especially in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets."}

This study reveals a pronounced scale-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices: under electron doping, carrier density decreases with increasing channel width (Wd), while the opposite occurs under hole doping. This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence. Utilizing machine learning with limited data, we optimized the device geometry, identifying a channel width of ~360 um as the optimal balance between resistance uncertainty and on-chip integration density. This work provides key insights for designing high-performance, miniaturized graphene-based QHRS arrays."}

Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself."}

However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moiré unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moiré of a 2$^{\\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moiré-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moiré excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures."}
