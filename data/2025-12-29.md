TL;DR: 该研究在双层石墨烯中，通过调控电场改变电子轨道，实验性地实现了复合费米子的配对相变，并发现了指向非阿贝尔量子霍尔态的新物相。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合费米子之间的有效相互作用可以稳定奇异的分数量子霍尔态。尤其在半满的朗道能级中，复合费米子可以呈现金属性或配对相。作者旨在通过实验控制朗道能级的轨道特性，来研究和实现复合费米子的配对相变。

Method: 研究人员使用双层石墨烯作为平台，通过施加位移电场来控制第一激发朗道能级中的电子轨道组成。他们进行了输运测量，并结合依赖于位移场的朗道能级波函数进行了数值研究。

Result: 在填充因子为v = 9/2和11/2时，输运测量显示，随着位移电场的增加，导电态逐渐转变为完善的量子霍尔平台。这些态对平面内磁场不敏感，表明它们是单分量基态，指向了非阿贝尔序。数值研究也支持了这种配对转变的轨道起源。

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了复合费米子的配对相变。实验和理论结果共同指出，新发现的配对态很可能是具有非阿贝尔统计的量子态（如Moore-Read态或anti-Pfaffian态），这为研究和调控奇异量子物态提供了新途径。

Abstract: The effective interaction between composite fermions, set entirely by the Coulomb potential and the underlying electronic Landau level orbitals, can stabilize exotic fractional quantum Hall states. In particular, half-filled Landau levels with different orbital character can host either metallic or paired phases of composite fermions. Here, we leverage experimental control over the orbital composition to realize a composite-fermion pairing transition in the first excited Landau level of bilayer graphene. Transport measurements at filling factors v = 9/2 and 11/2 reveal conductive states giving way to well-developed plateaus with increasing displacement fields. These states are insensitive to an in-plane magnetic field, indicating single-component ground states and thus pointing at non-Abelian orders. Our numerical study, based on displacement-field-dependent Landau-level wavefunctions, supports the orbital origin of the pairing transition and suggests Moore-Read or anti-Pfaffian ground states.

TL;DR: 本文研究了磁性拓扑绝缘体 MnBi2Te4 的量子相干输运性质，发现了其中存在极长的相干长度，并揭示了其在构建新型量子自旋干涉仪方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管本征磁性拓扑绝缘体（如 MnBi2Te4）中的量子化现象已被广泛研究，但与其载流子相位相关的量子输运性质仍未被探索。

Method: 研究人员通过使用从块状 MnBi2Te4 晶体中剥离出的厚薄片，制造了介观尺度的霍尔巴器件，并在低温下对其进行量子相干输运性质的测量。

Result: 研究发现了在介观磁体中前所未有的长相干长度（在1K下约500纳米），这与二维拓扑表面态有关。实验观察到了由非局域量子干涉引起的巨大普适电导涨落（约20e²/h），并识别出了不同的退相干机制。

Conclusion: 磁性拓扑绝缘体纳米结构中观测到的弱退相干现象，表明它们在液氦温度下有潜力被用于实现基于局部磁织构退相干的新型量子自旋干涉仪。

Abstract: Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators can host quantum states with quantized magneto-electric responses, such as the axion and Chern insulators states evidenced in ultra-thin MnBi2Te4 films. Yet, whereas quantization is investigated thoroughly, transport properties related to the phase of charge carriers remains unexplored. Here, we study quantum coherent transport in mesoscopic Hall bars fabricated from thick exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes, and reveal the longest phase-coherence length ever observed in a mesoscopic magnet (about 500nm at 1K), associated to 2D topological surface states. In the fully-coherent regime, significant non-local contributions to quantum interference up to the micron scale lead to giant-amplitude universal conductance fluctuations (about 20e2/h). In the self-averaging regime, the statistical properties of conductance fluctuations confirm the 2D nature of quantum interference and different dephasing mechanisms are identified, as due to either magnetism or magnetic flux through coherent loops. Remarkably, the weak decoherence in magnetic topological insulator nanostructures show their potential to realize novel quantum spin interferometers based on dephasing by local magnetic textures at liquid-helium temperatures.

TL;DR: 本文首次在三维耗散声子晶体中实验实现了一种高阶外尔异常环半金属，并观察到了作为其特征的、能在高损耗下稳定传播的拓扑铰链态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管厄米体系（Hermitian）中的高阶拓扑材料和非厄米体系（non-Hermitian）中的一阶拓扑材料已有广泛研究，但高阶的非厄米拓扑材料研究才刚刚起步。本文旨在首次实验实现一种名为“高阶外尔异常环半金属”的新物相。

Method: 研究人员设计并构建了一个三维耗散声子晶体（3D lossy phononic crystal），通过这个物理系统来模拟和实现高阶外尔异常环半金属的特性。

Result: 1. 成功实现了高阶外尔异常环半金属。
2. 实验观察到了其标志性特征：拓扑铰链态（topological hinge states）和铰链依赖的趋肤效应（hinge-dependent skin effect）。
3. 一个关键发现是，即使在系统存在高损耗的情况下，这些拓扑铰链态依然能稳定传播。

Conclusion: 该研究为非厄米体系中的高阶体-边对应关系（bulk-boundary correspondence）提供了实验证据，并可能为开发新型非厄米功能声学器件铺平道路。

Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological phase, with the novel concepts such as exceptional points and skin effect, has opened up a new paradigm beyond Hermitian topological physics. Exceptional ring semimetal, featured by a stable ring of exceptional points in three dimensions, exhibits first-order topological properties, including topological surface states and surface-dependent skin effect. Nevertheless, despite extensive research on Hermitian higher-order insulators and semimetals, higher-order exceptional ring semimetal is just emerging. Here, we report the first realization of a higher-order Weyl exceptional ring semimetal in a three-dimensional lossy phononic crystal. The non-Hermitian higher-order topology reflects in the topological hinge states and hinge-dependent skin effect. Counterintuitively, the topological hinge states maintain purely real energy even under a high loss level, ensuring robust hinge-state propagation. Our findings evidence the non-Hermitian higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence of exceptional ring semimetal, and may pave the way to non-Hermitian functional acoustic devices.

TL;DR: 研究团队在一种石墨烯莫尔超晶格中，于通常认为不会出现拓扑态的偶数填充（v=2）条件下，意外发现了一个陈数为1的量子反常霍尔效应，并从理论上解释了其来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在石墨烯基莫尔超晶格中，由强相互作用驱动的拓扑态（如陈绝缘体）通常在奇数填充时才稳定，而在偶数填充时则往往是拓扑平庸的。本研究旨在探索在偶数填充下出现拓扑非平庸态的可能性。

Method: 实验上，构筑了菱面八层石墨烯（R8G）与六方氮化硼（hBN）形成的莫尔超晶格进行测量。理论上，通过哈特里-福克（Hartree-Fock）计算进行验证，结果表明该状态源于低能平带和高能远程能带的纠缠。

Result: 在菱面八层石墨烯/氮化硼（R8G/hBN）的莫尔超晶格中，当莫尔填充数为v=2（偶数填充）时，观测到了一个陈数C=1的本征陈绝缘体态，即量子反常霍尔效应（QAHE）。

Conclusion: 该发现扩展了菱面多层石墨烯（RMG）莫尔体系的已知拓扑相图，并证明了该平台在研究强电子关联和多能带杂化输运方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Graphene-based moire superlattices exhibit novel quantum phenomena driven by pronounced interactions, leading to topological corrected states like orbital Chern insulators exhibiting quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Typically, intrinsic Chern insulators are stabilized at odd moiré fillings, as even fillings often result in valley-balanced, topologically trivial states at zero magnetic field. In our work, we report the observation of an intrinsic Chern insulator with C = 1 state at moire filling v = 2 in rhombohedral octalayer graphene (R8G)/hBN moire superlattice. Observing such Chern insulators in particular with C = 1 at v = 2 is intriguing, as each moiré band carries Chern number C = 1 or -1. We further demonstrate such a state can originate from the entanglement between the low-energy moire flat bands and high-energy remote bands according to the Hartree-Fock calculation. Our findings extend the known topological phase diagram of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) moire systems and establish this platform as highly promising for investigating strong electron correlations and multiband hybridized transport.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了磁振子凝聚体在电场作用下如何通过几何相位效应自发转变为铁电态，并在此过程中产生了持续的超流和一种奇异的、类似马约拉纳费米子的玻色子准粒子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究磁振子玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体中的一种铁电不稳定性。这种不稳定性由磁振子通过几何的阿哈罗诺夫-卡舍尔（Aharonov-Casher, AC）相应与电场相互作用所介导，形成一个正反馈循环：电场通过AC相应引发磁振子轨道运动，该运动产生电极化，进而增强原始电场。

Method: 本研究采用了玻色子体系的博戈留波夫-德热纳（Bogoliubov-de Gennes, BdG）平均场理论进行分析。

Result: 研究表明，该正反馈驱动了磁振子超流体中自发的铁电相变，并伴随着持续的磁振子超流。在形成的铁电相中，准粒子激发谱变得非互易，反映了空间反演对称性的自发破缺。在相变临界点，系统哈密顿量出现了一个“奇异点”（exceptional point），其对应的本征矢量是准粒子和准空穴态的等权重叠加，可被视为马约拉纳费米子在玻色子体系中的类似物。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了由阿哈罗诺夫-卡舍尔（Aharonov-Casher）效应驱动的磁振子凝聚体中的一种新颖铁电相。该相展现出超流和非互易激发等独特性质，并在相变临界点发现了类似马约拉纳费米子的奇异玻色子准粒子，为凝聚态物理学提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We investigate a ferroelectric instability of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensate, mediated by its interaction with an electric field through a geometric Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. A distinct feature of the system is the positive feedback loop in which an electric field induces magnon orbital motion via the AC phase, generating electric polarization that in turn enhances the original field. Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point. The corresponding eigenvector is an equally weighted superposition of bosonic quasiparticle and quasihole states and is invariant under particle-hole transformation, allowing it to be interpreted as a bosonic analog of a Majorana fermion.

Motivation: 本文旨在在无需外加磁场的条件下探索分数电荷激发和任意子统计，并验证基于晶格的系统是否能产生超越传统分数量子霍尔系统的新物态。

Method: 研究人员构建并研究了一种由伯纳尔双层石墨烯（Bernal bilayer graphene）和菱形四层石墨烯（rhombohedral tetralayer graphene）组成的新型摩尔平带系统，并观察其在不同填充因子下的电子态。

Result: 实验观察到了具有高整数陈数（C=2到7）的一系列量子反常霍尔态。最关键的是，在填充因子 v=2/3 附近发现了一个陈数为 C=7/3 的奇特分数陈绝缘体，该状态无法被任何已知理论（如Jain序列）所描述。

Conclusion: 这项工作将对分数电荷激发的理解扩展到了朗道能级理论框架之外，并为探索任意子等奇异量子现象提供了一个新的摩尔材料平台。

Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators opens up the possibility of exploring fractionally charged excitations and anyonic statistics in the absence of a magnetic field. One of the central questions is whether lattice-based systems can give rise to radically new states, distinct from those observed in traditional fractional quantum Hall systems. In this work, we investigate a new type of moire flat band system composed of Bernal bilayer graphene and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. First, we discover an unprecedented richness of states with high Chern numbers. At v = 1 moire filling, we observe Chern insulators with Chern numbers C = 4 and 3. Flanking v = 3 state, we observe a series of Chern insulators from C = 2 to C = 7. All of these states exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Remarkably, we observe an exotic fractional Chern insulator with C = 7/3 around v = 2/3 which is beyond all known fractional Chern insulators described by either the Jain sequence as or current high Chern theory. Our work expands the understanding of fractionally charged excitations beyond the Landau level basis and offers a new moiré platform for exploring anyons.

Abstract: We demonstrate that topological insulators exhibit an intrinsic interfacial instability that amplifies small interface fluctuations, resulting in chaotic behavior during interface growth. This mechanism is fundamentally different from conventional interfacial instabilities in crystal growth that are driven by external non-uniformities such as surface diffusion, and instead arises from intrinsic electronic properties of topological materials. We find that the boundary states of topological insulators have a pronounced impact on the surface stiffness, which quantifies how strongly a surface resists changes in its shape or orientation. While trivial insulators possess positive stiffness that smooths out surface roughness, topological insulators exhibit negative stiffness that amplifies small shape fluctuations. We derive an effective equation of the interface growth with this negative stiffness and demonstrate that the interface dynamics is governed by the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, a prototypical nonlinear equation exhibiting spatiotemporal chaos.

Abstract: We present a first-principles and quantum transport study of proximity-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in graphene on a trigonal CrSBr monolayer. Density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function calculations shows that the CrSBr substrate induces spin polarization and a sizable exchange splitting in the graphene Dirac states. The resulting current-driven spin density in graphene generates a self-SOT on the Dirac electrons. The proximity-induced exchange field breaks time-reversal symmetry and gives rise to a purely odd SOT component, while the even contribution vanishes. The torque magnitude exhibits a strong angular dependence with phase shifts arising from the noncollinearity between the CrSBr magnetization and the induced magnetic moments in graphene. Monte Carlo simulations based on the calculated exchange parameters predict a Curie temperature of approximately 304 K, confirming the robustness of ferromagnetism in the trigonal CrSBr monolayer. These results identify graphene/CrSBr heterostructures as a promising platform for room-temperature two-dimensional spintronics.

Abstract: Multi-terminal topological devices are a new generation of electronic devices with quantized properties robust against imperfections. In magnetic topological insulators, dissipationless edge states give functional devices in zero magnetic field, of interest for quantum metrology (resistance standard) or topological electronics (Chern networks). Here we show that a new generation of simple quantum circuits (disk, ring) with non-Hermitian topology, based on the interconnection of 1D Chern states in the quantum anomalous Hall regime, can have a much stronger quantization of their invariant than that of the Chern invariant itself, when measured in a non-metrology grade setup - that is, in industry-relevant conditions. Remarkably, the chirality-related topological skin effect is realized without the need of a magnetic field or an electrical gate, with a record degree of localization for a quantum Hall device. This new type of topological quantum devices based on magnets, with an exponential response that can be switched at small magnetic fields (about 200mT), can operate at liquid-Helium temperature with a good quantization and have some potential as cryogenic sensors for applications in high-precision impedance or magnetic field measurements.

Abstract: A periodically driven Fermi gas coupled to a simple boson bath reaches a non-equilibrium steady-state occupation with sharp non-analyticities at certain momenta. Here, we demonstrate that these non-analyticities behave as emergent Fermi surfaces by showing that they give rise to quantum oscillations of observables with a period controlled by the effective Fermi surface area enclosed by these non-analyticities. However, these oscillations have several striking differences with standard equilibrium quantum oscillations. For example, they remain non-analytic at finite temperatures, their amplitude can survive up to extremely high temperatures comparable to the frequency of the drive, and they can display non-monotonic temperature dependence completely at odds with standard Lifshits-Kosevich behavior.

Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.

Abstract: Crystallographic groups are conventionally studied in real space to characterize crystal symmetries. Recent work has recognized that when these symmetries are realized projectively, momentum space inherently accommodates nonsymmorphic symmetries, thereby evoking the concept of \textit{momentum-space crystallographic groups} (MCGs). Here, we reveal that the cohomology of MCGs encodes fundamental data of crystalline topological band structures. Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(Γ_F,\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $Γ_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(Γ_F,\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory. Furthermore, we establish the isomorphism $H^{n+1}(Γ_F,\mathbb{Z})\cong H^n\big(Γ_F,\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))\big)$ for $ n\ge 1$, where $\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))$ denotes the space of continuous $U(1)$-valued functions on the $d$D momentum space $\mathbb{R}^d_F$. The case $n=1$ yields a complete set of topological invariants formulated in purely algebraic terms, which differs fundamentally from the conventional formulation in terms of differential forms. The case $n=2$, analogously, provides a fully algebraic description for all such twistings. Thus, the cohomological theory of MCGs serves as a key technical framework for analyzing crystalline topological phases within the general setting of projective symmetry.

Abstract: Absorption of an isolated bulk magnetic skyrmion into an empty domain wall in a chiral ferromagnetic system is studied using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with and without the demagnetization effect taken into account. The full phase diagram of creation versus repulsion or annihilation is mapped out in case of both Bloch-type and Néel-type DMI, with and without demagnetization. Finally, the unstable domain wall, realizable with a setup of several external magnets, contains the theoretical possibility of producing a 1-dimensional version of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which in turn can create a number of skyrmion-anti-skyrmion pairs engulfed in the domain wall: We denote them domain-wall-skyrmion-anti-domain-wall-skyrmion pairs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Finite coherent quantum systems exhibit a nontrivial response to local sources of phase curvature, which cannot be reduced to conventional forces, disorder-induced localization, or simple gap opening. Here we show that, in finite fermionic rings, a localized symmetry-breaking perturbation acts as a source of phase curvature in the many-body Hilbert space, inducing an anomalous breakdown of global phase rigidity. Starting from a Hubbard-Peierls description, we derive an effective field-theoretic functional in which the inverse local susceptibility defines a phase-rigidity scale controlled by system size and electronic correlations. This rigidity quantifies the resistance of a coherent many-body state to geometric deformation of its phase structure, rather than to energetic localization. We demonstrate that interactions enhance phase rigidity in finite systems, counter to naive expectations based on single-particle localization, and that rigidity loss may occur without a direct correspondence to gap formation. Molecular pi-electron rings and mesoscopic quantum circuits provide experimentally accessible realizations of this regime, establishing a direct connection between local phase curvature, geometric rigidity, and coherence-driven phenomena across finite quantum matter.

Abstract: The impact of projective lattice symmetry on electronic band structures has attracted significant attention in recent years, particularly in light of growing experimental studies of two-dimensional hexagonal materials in magnetic fields. Yet, most theoretical work to date has focused on the square lattice due to its relative simplicity. In this work, we investigate the role of projective lattice symmetry in a hexagonal lattice with rational magnetic flux, emphasizing the resulting topological constraints on the electronic band structure. We show that, at pi flux, the symmetry in the hexagonal lattice enforces novel Dirac band touchings at E not equal to zero, and for general rational flux it constrains the number of Dirac points at E = 0. We further analyze the symmetry-imposed constraints on the Chern numbers of both isolated gapped bands and band multiplets connected by Dirac-point touchings. Our results demonstrate that these constraints in the hexagonal lattice differ substantially from those in the square lattice.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology shows great potential in 6G communications and imaging, but faces challenges related to detector sensitivity, noise, and cryogenic operation. Here, we integrate interferometric enhancement of absorption (IEA) from a metal reflection layer with a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC)-based photodetector. The hybrid configuration enhances the in-plane electric field and improves the plasmon-induced thermal gradient. Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were employed to systematically investigate the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device, which reveals the IEA design significantly boosts the THz absorption rate in graphene nanostructures and promotes asymmetry in the lateral diffusion of hot carriers. Compared with the bare device, the responsivity of the device is enhanced by approximately 30-folds, while maintaining a response time below 130 μs. We further demonstrate the potential of the device to distinguish concealed liquids, advancing high-responsivity, room-temperature, and compact terahertz imaging technology.

Result: 训练后的模型预测能力很强，在测试数据上实现的决定系数R²为0.9439，均方根误差为14.94 K，平均绝对误差为11.58 K。此外，类激活图分析显示，模型重点关注工具与材料接触的界面区域，这与物理上剧烈变形和产热的位置相符。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，通过原子模拟数据进行空间学习，可以准确再现搅拌摩擦焊中的温度趋势，并与原子尺度上观察到的物理变形和流动机制保持一致。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of temperature evolution is essential for understanding thermomechanical behavior in friction stir welding. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale.

TL;DR: 本研究合成了一种新型的掺氟钙镁硅酸盐生物材料，并发现1 mol%的氟掺杂量能最大限度地提高其在生物医学应用中的磷灰石形成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在开发用于生物医学应用的钙镁硅酸盐，并探索将氟化物掺入其中如何影响其结构特性、生物矿化能力和生物降解性。

Method: 研究人员使用无机盐共沉淀法，然后进行煅烧/烧结，合成了一系列用不同含量氟化物取代氧化物的钙镁氧氟硅酸盐。他们通过多种光谱和显微镜技术（如XRD、TEM、SEM/EDX等）来评估材料的结构、磷灰石形成能力和生物降解性。

Result: 研究发现，氟含量高达2 mol%的样品能形成掺氟的透辉石（MgCaSi2O6）单相结构。实现最佳生物矿化（形成磷灰石的能力）的最佳氟含量为1 mol%。这个最佳值归因于氟部分融入了新形成的磷灰石中，同时避免了会消耗钙离子的萤石（CaF2）副产物的形成。

Conclusion: 该研究证实，优化钙镁硅酸盐中的氟掺杂量对于开发新的生物医学材料具有重要价值。

Abstract: In this research, a novel group of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates containing different levels of fluoride substituting for oxide was synthesized by an inorganic salt coprecipitation process followed by calcination/sintering. The effects of the incorporation of fluoride on the resultant structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability and biodegradability were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and pH measurements. According to the results, the samples containing up to 2 mol% F present a single-phase structure of diopside (MgCaSi2O6) doped with F. It was also found that to meet the most biomineralization characteristic, the optimal value of fluoride in the homogeneous samples is 1 mol%. In this regard, on the one hand, the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (via forming fluorohydroxyapatite) and, on the other hand, the absence of fluorite (CaF2) as a consumer of Ca in the deposits are responsible for achieving the most apatite-forming ability circumstance controlled by an ion-exchange reaction mechanism. In conclusion, this study reflects the merit of the optimization of fluoride-doping into Ca-Mg silicates for development in biomedicine.

Motivation: 受到碳元素既有层状石墨结构又有非层状金刚石结构的启发，研究人员希望探索那些通常被认为是非层状的材料（如黄铁矿型金属二硫化物）是否也可能存在隐藏的、更稳定的层状二维结构。

Abstract: Carbon exhibits both a layered ground state structure that produces two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets and a non-layered diamond structure created under high pressure conditions. Motivated by this metastability relationship, we revisit the ground state structure of metal dichalcogenides that are known to have non-layered pyrite-type structure. Ultrathin films of pyrite-type ZnSe$_2$ spontaneously transform into a layered phase. This phase is identified as a ground state, and the monolayer exhibits strong elastic anisotropy and a semiconducting bandgap larger than that of the pyrite phase by a factor of two. We demonstrate that a two-valued but directional potential energy surface exists along a Bain-like distortion path, hiding the layered ground state. This work implies that many 2D materials are hidden in non-layered materials and connects 2D materials science with surface and high-pressure science.

Abstract: We propose a fractionally quantized polarization induced by interlayer sliding in bilayer altermagnets, unveiling a previously unrecognized multiferroic phase termed sliding fractional quantum multiferroicity (SFQM). This unconventional magnetic phase uniquely integrates sliding ferroelectricity with fractional quantum ferroelectricity, enabling highly efficient switching and nonvolatile electrical control of spin.~Unlike conventional multiferroics, SFQM simultaneously exhibits lattice-scale atomic displacements, ultralow switching barriers, and spin splitting, giving rise to a large fractionally quantized polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify bilayer altermagnet Ca(CoN)$_2$ and its family materials as promising candidates hosting SFQM. In contrast to gate-controlled schemes, the spin-layer coupling in SFQM is intrinsically induced by spontaneous electrical and layer polarization, requiring no sustained gate field and exhibiting nonvolatile character. This mechanism enables nonvolatile electrical control of spin through biaxial sliding, where displacements along the \textit{x}- and \textit{y}-axes generate opposite polarization directions in the layer-dependent electrical polarization. Furthermore, SFQM exhibits a fully switchable anomalous Hall effect and a pronounced magneto-optical response, which can be utilized for its detection and distinction. These findings highlight the promising role of sliding-mediated couplings among unconventional magnetism, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, and stacking order in realizing electrically controllable two-dimensional multiferroics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在密度泛函理论框架下考虑自相互作用校正（SIC）的从头计算方法，用于计算晶体势，并通过计算 LiCl 的吸收光谱验证了该方法在高能区间的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的本地电子密度泛函理论未能充分处理自相互作用能，导致计算结果（如能谱）不准确。本文旨在提出一种从头计算方法，通过引入自相互作用校正（SIC）来改进晶体势的计算，以期无需拟合实验数据即可获得精确的电子光谱。

Method: 本文提出了一种在局域电子密度泛函理论框架下的从头计算方法。该方法为晶体势引入了自相互作用能量校正（SIC），并推导出一个满足晶胞电中性条件的自洽 muffin-tin-SIC 势。作者将此方案应用于计算氯化锂（LiCl）的基本吸收边光谱。

Result: 计算得到的 LiCl 带间跃迁能量无需与实验值进行拟合。在离吸收边约 2.5 eV以上的区域，计算出的光谱峰形和位置与实验测量结果相当吻合。这表明该区域的光谱强度主要源于带间跃遷。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的从头计算 SIC 方法能够很好地解释 LiCl 吸收光谱中高能区的带间跃迁。然而，在靠近吸收边的区域，电子-空穴相互作用（激子效应）对基态有显著影响，因此要准确计算整个光谱，必须考虑这种相互作用。

Abstract: Within the framework of the local electron density functional theory, an ab-initio method is proposed that takes into account the self-interaction energy correction (SIC) for the crystal potential. The principle of dividing the unit cell into regions remained the same as for the ground-state potential. The expression for the self-consistent muffin-tin-SIC potential satisfies the condition of cell electroneutrality. This scheme was applied to calculate the spectrum of the fundamental absorption edge of LiCl. The obtained interband transition energies were not required for fitting to experimental values. In the calculated spectrum, the shape and position of the peaks above ~2.5 eV from the edge agree fairly well with the measured ones, which allows their intensity in this region to be attributed primarily to interband transitions. Closer to the edge, electron-hole interaction significantly alters the ground state, which must be taken into account when calculating the spectrum shape.

Abstract: Given the scarcity of experimentally confirmed magnetic structures, the reliable prediction of magnetic ground states is crucial; however, it remains a long-sought challenge because of the complex magnetic potential energy landscape. Here, we propose a symmetry-guided framework that systematically generates realistic magnetic configurations without requiring any experimental input or prior assumptions such as propagation vectors. Within a hierarchical symmetry-breaking scenario, we integrate the recently developed spin space group formalism and conventional magnetic space group description, respectively capturing symmetry breaking induced by magnetic ordering and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we perform both nonrelativistic and relativistic first-principles calculations to establish the energy ordering of selected magnetic configurations. Exemplified by three recently reported three-dimensional unconventional magnets MnTe, Mn3Sn, and CoNb3S6 and two two-dimensional magnets CrTe2 and NiI2, we demonstrate that only a few dozen first-principles calculations are sufficient to identify the ground-state magnetic configuration along with several low-energy metastable states, which may exhibit exotic physical properties such as p-wave magnetism. Our work provides a general and efficient strategy for large-scale prediction of three-dimensional and two-dimensional magnetic configurations and offers insight into the microscopic origins of magnetic interactions across diverse material systems.

Abstract: MnBi2Te4 is a versatile platform for exploring diverse topological quantum states, yet its potential is hampered by intrinsic antisite defects. While Sb substitution has been employed to tune the Fermi level towards the charge neutral point, it exacerbates the formation of Mn-Sb antisite defects. Here, we address this challenge by combining first-principles calculations with strategic synthesis to systematically investigate and control antisite defects in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4. Our calculations reveal that increasing antisite defect density progressively destroys the field-forced magnetic Weyl state, eventually driving the system into a trivial magnetic insulator. Motivated by these findings, we develop an optimized chemical vapor transport method, yielding high-quality Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 crystals with significantly reduced antisite defect density. The emergence of strong Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the forced ferromagnetic state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect near charge neutrality, with opposite signs for n- and p-type samples, confirms the type-II Weyl semimetal nature. These findings underscore the critical role of antisite defects in determining the magnetic and topological properties of Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 and establish defect engineering via optimized synthesis as a crucial strategy for realizing its exotic magnetic topological states.

Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet CsFeCl$_3$ under high magnetic fields and high pressure. Pulsed-field magnetization for the magnetic field along the symmetric $c$ direction at ambient pressure reveals a magnetization process from a nonmagnetic singlet ground state with a nearly linear increase between 3.7 and 10.7 T, a plateau-like region, and then a sharp stepwise metamagnetic transition near 32 T. Wide frequency--field range electron spin resonance indicates that the low-field regime originates from the $J = 1$ manifold, while the high-field metamagnetic transition suggests a level crossing between the $J = 1$ and $J = 2$ lowest states. Pulsed-field magnetic susceptibilities measured with a proximity detector oscillator under high pressure show that the low-field nonmagnetic singlet phase is gradually suppressed, while the high-field metamagnetic transition evolves into an increasingly rich pattern of fractional steps. While the observations at low to intermediate fields can be understood within the established spin-1 description, the high-field regime requires a new perspective, which we provide through a projected spin-1/2 framework built from Zeeman-selected crystal-field states not related by time reversal. This construction naturally allows emergent three-body interactions on triangular plaquettes and explains the asymmetric evolution of the fractional steps in the magnetization. Our findings reveal that high-field effective spin models in quantum magnets with separated yet accessible crystal-field multiplets are not constrained to even-body couplings, but can naturally host odd-body terms, opening a broader avenue for realizing field-asymmetric magnetization processes and exotic phases beyond conventional even-body physics.

Abstract: Ni-W based medium heavy alloys offer a promising pathway to bridge the density-strength gap between tungsten heavy alloys and ultrahigh-strength steels. In this study, the effects of W concentration on short-range order (SRO), deformation behavior, and grain boundary chemistry of Ni-xW alloys in the range x = 0 to 38 wt% were systematically investigated using a suite of advanced characterization and modeling techniques, including synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, atom probe tomography, and first-principles thermodynamic simulations. Our study reveals that strong SRO emerges when W content exceeds about 30 wt%, producing distinct diffuse scattering and significantly enhancing strain-hardening capacity. During deformation, the presence of SRO promotes planar slip and twin formation, leading to strong dislocation interactions and elevated flow stress. Hall-Petch analysis demonstrates an exceptionally high grain boundary strengthening coefficient (ky about 1100 MPa micrometer^(1/2)) in Ni-38W, underscoring the intrinsic strengthening effect associated with SRO. First-principles cluster expansion coupled with Monte Carlo simulations reveals that increasing W content enhances SRO tendency through the stabilization of Ni4W-type local configurations. These findings establish a mechanistic link between W concentration, SRO evolution, and mechanical response, providing new insights for designing high-density, high-strength Ni-W based alloys with optimized performance.

Abstract: After the synthesis of the carbon biphenylene network (C-BPN), research has increasingly focused on adapting elements from other groups of the periodic table to this lattice structure. In this study, the direction-dependent electronic, thermal, and thermoelectric (TE) properties of semiconducting group-III (group-III = B, Al, Ga, In) nitride biphenylene networks are investigated using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with first-principles calculations. Phonon spectra and force field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to asses the dynamically and thermally stable structures. At room temperature, the lowest phonon thermal conductance values are obtained for InN-BPN, with $κ_{\mathrm{ph}}$ = 0.12 nW/K/nm and $κ_{\mathrm{ph}}$ = 0.21 nW/K/nm along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The nearly dispersionless valence-band region between the $Γ$--$X$ symmetry points causes a sharp increase in the $p$-type electronic transmission, which significantly enhances the $p$-type thermoelectric figure of merit, $zT$. Among the investigated group-III nitride BPNs, InN-BPN exhibits the best performance, with a $p$-type $zT$ value of 2.33 in the zigzag direction at 800 K.

Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulating these properties remains poorly understood. We investigate Sb-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4 to 273 K), high-pressure studies (0 to 30 GPa), powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping dramatically improves phase purity, eliminating all impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine and Bi-doped samples while retaining only the three fundamental [TiCl$_6$]$^{2-}$ octahedral vibrations. This enhanced purity reveals a previously unobserved structural phenomenon: Sb-doped samples (2\% doped and 3\%) incorporated) exhibit a sharp anomaly at 100 K marked by the emergence of a new Raman mode M$_1$ at 314--319 cm$^{-1}$ and abrupt changes in the temperature coefficient $χ$ (factor of 2--8$\times$ change) and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. No such transition occurs in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, indicating Sb-dopant-induced order-disorder transformation. The enhanced phonon anharmonicity in Sb-doped samples directly manifests in photoluminescence: self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm shows 19\% broader FWHM (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), confirming stronger electron-phonon coupling. High-pressure measurements reveal structural robustness to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These findings establish that strategic Sb doping not only improves material quality but also enables a novel low-temperature structural transition, providing fundamental insights into dopant-mediated phase control in vacancy-ordered perovskites for next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: We present a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate framework for molecular dynamics simulations that directly predicts atomic displacements and learns the underlying evolution operator of an atomistic system. Unlike conventional molecular dynamics, which relies on repeated force evaluations and numerical time integration, the proposed surrogate model propagates atomic configurations forward in time without explicit force computation. The approach represents atomic environments as graphs and combines message-passing layers with attention mechanisms to capture local coordination and many-body interactions in metallic systems. Trained on classical molecular dynamics trajectories of bulk aluminum, the surrogate achieves sub angstrom level accuracy within the training horizon and exhibits stable behavior during short- to mid-horizon temporal extrapolation. Structural and dynamical fidelity are validated through agreement with reference radial distribution functions and mean squared displacement trends, demonstrating that the model preserves key physical signatures beyond pointwise coordinate accuracy. These results establish GNN-based surrogate integrators as a promising and computationally efficient complement to traditional molecular dynamics for accelerated atomistic simulations within a validated regime.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of predicting vibrational stability in inorganic semiconductors for high-throughput screening, an essential attribute for evaluating synthesizability alongside thermodynamic stability, frequently missing in prominent materials databases. We create a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that incorporates the Born stability requirements directly into its loss function. This integration is a key learning constraint since it only allows the model to make predictions that do not violate fundamental physics. The model shows consistent and improved performance, having been trained on a dataset of 2112 inorganic materials with validated phonon spectra, and getting an F1-score of 0.83 for both stable and unstable classes. The model shows an AUC-ROC of 0.82 on a benchmark dataset of 1296 materials. Our PINN surpasses the best models in comparative tests, especially when it comes to accurately identifying unstable materials, which is crucial for a stability filter. This work offers a comprehensive screening tool for identifying materials and a methodology for incorporating domain knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy in materials informatics.

Abstract: van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy is conventionally regarded as a rotation-free and strain-free growth mode driven by weak, isotropic interactions, yet many interfaces paradoxically exhibit strictly locked orientations that defy standard surface-energy models. We resolve this inconsistency by establishing a unified quantitative framework for 2D-3D systems, in which strong electrostatic and chemical interactions compete with entropic forces. We introduce a two-tier descriptor set-the predictive index (I_pre) and the thermodynamic locking criterion (I_lock)-to quantify the energetic sufficiency for locked epitaxy. Our theory accurately predicted the competitive interactions at the interface within the 2D-3D system, precisely characterized whether the epitaxial layer underwent free growth or was constrained in a locked growth mode, demonstrating robust consistency with diverse experimental observations. This framework unifies orientation selection in 3D-on-2D films and rotational locking in 2D-on-3D layers within a single-phase diagram. Our work provides a generalizable, predictive route to controlling epitaxial orientation across a broad spectrum of layered heterostructure

Abstract: High-quality metallocene single crystals with a low density of impurities and high homogeneity were prepared using the physical vapor transport method. These crystals were then characterized using various spectroscopic tools and X-ray diffraction. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metal ions in each freshly grown sample despite all these crystals undergoing physical deformation with different lifetimes. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that all our metallocene single crystals retained a monoclinic structure at room temperature. The vibrational properties of our metallocene crystals were examined using Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The inter- and intra-ring vibrational modes, along with additional modes associated with the crystalline form, were identified as inherent vibrational properties of our metallocene single crystals. Given the increasingly important role of metallocene in organic solar cells, organic light-emitting displays and molecular quantum systems, this research will enhance our understanding of the intrinsic physical properties of cleaner, more crystalline metallocene single crystals.

Abstract: Ferroaxial order is characterized by the breaking of mirror symmetry parallel to the crystallographic principal axis, which often originates from spontaneous rotational distortions of the crystal lattice. Such rotational distortions are, by symmetry, allowed to couple to specific phonon modes. However, Raman-active phonons associated with these rotational distortions have not yet been clearly identified on a symmetry-consistent basis. Here, we perform polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy on the ferroaxial phase of Na2BaNi(PO4)2 single crystals and combine the measurements with first-principles lattice-dynamics calculations. This symmetry-guided analysis enables a comprehensive assignment of Raman-active modes in the ferroaxial phase. Several low-frequency Ag modes exhibit finite linewidth broadening, suggesting that these phonons may be weakly affected by the underlying rotational distortion. These results establish a symmetry-based spectroscopic framework for analyzing phonons associated with rotational distortions in ferroaxial materials and provide a basis for future studies of ferroaxial order in complex oxides.

Abstract: Increasing the valley splitting in Si-based heterostructures is critical for improving the performance of semiconductor qubits. This paper demonstrates that the two low-energy conduction band valleys are not independent parabolic bands. Instead, they originate from the X-point of the Brillouin zone, where they are interconnected by a degeneracy protected by the non-symmorphic symmetry of the diamond lattice. This semi-Dirac-node degeneracy gives rise to the $Δ_1$ and $Δ_{2'}$ bands, which constitute the valley degrees of freedom. By explicitly computing the two-component Bloch functions $X_1^\pm$, using the wave vector group at the X-point, we determine the transformation properties of the object $(X_1^+,X_1^-)$. We demonstrate that these properties are fundamentally different from those of a spinor. Consequently, we introduce the term "valleyor" to emphasize this fundamental distinction. The transformation properties of valleyors induce corresponding transformations of the Pauli matrices $τ_1,τ_2$ and $τ_3$ in the valley space. Determining these transformations allows us to classify possible external perturbations that couple to each valley Pauli matrix, thereby identifying candidates for valley-magnetic fields, ${\mathsf B}$. These fields are defined by a Zeeman-like coupling ${\mathsf B}\cdot\vecτ$ to the valley degree of freedom. In this way, we identify scenarios where an applied magnetic field $\vec B$ can leverage other background fields, such as strain, to generate a valley-magnetic field ${\mathsf B}$. This analysis suggests that beyond the well-known mechanism of potential scattering from Ge impurities, there exist additional channels (mediated by combinations of magnetic and strain-induced vector potentials) to control the valley degree of freedom

Abstract: Thin-film transistors based on amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are promising candidates for enabling further DRAM scaling and 3D integration, which are critical for advanced computing. Despite extensive research, the charge transport mechanism in these disordered semiconductors remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate charge transport in the archetypical AOS material, indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), across a range of compositions and temperatures using thin-film transistors and Hall bar structures. Our results show that the electrons involved in transport exhibit partially spatial coherence and non-degenerate conduction. Under these conditions, transport is dominated by electron transfer across insulating gaps between locally coherent regions, rather than by degenerate percolative transport above a mobility edge, or by localized-state hopping, both of which are widely assumed in the literature. While fluctuation-induced tunnelling has previously been invoked to describe low-temperature transport in oxide transistors, we show that such behavior originates from partially coherent electronic states and develop a field-effect-aware fluctuation-induced tunnelling (FEAFIT) framework that explicitly accounts for gate modulation of the tunneling landscape. The FEAFIT model accurately predicts experimental data across all compositions, temperatures, and gate voltages, enabling extraction of fundamental transport parameters. These tunnelling parameters are then correlated with electron coherence dimensions and the degree of energetic disorder obtained from first-principles calculations. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of charge transport in AOS-based transistors and provide a foundation for further performance improvements

Abstract: We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of the layered pnictides EuMnXBi2 (X = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn), focusing in particular on the relatively unexplored Bi-based member of the EuMn2X2 family. Unlike the well-studied As-, Sb-, and P--based analogues, we show that EuMn2Bi2 stabilizes in a C-type antiferromagnetic ground state with a narrow-gap semiconducting character. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) drives a transition from this trivial antiferromagnetic semiconductor to a Weyl semimetal hosting four symmetry-related Weyl points and robust Fermi arc states. Systematic substitution of Mn with Fe, Co, and Zn further reveals a tunable sequence of magnetic ground states: Fe and Co induce ferrimagnetism with semimetallic behavior, while Zn stabilizes a ferromagnetic semimetal with a large net moment. These findings establish Bi-based EuMnXBi2 pnictides as a versatile platform where magnetic exchange interactions and band topology can be engineered through SOC and chemical substitution. The complex interplay of magnetic interactions and topological effects in the proposed bulk and doped pnictides opens a promising avenue to explore a wide range of electronic and magnetic phenomena. In particular, this study demonstrates that EuMn2Bi2 hosts tunable magnetic and topological phases driven by electron correlations, chemical substitution, and spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the dissociation of CO$_2$ on Cu(110) by performing density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional, with a potential energy surface parameterized using artificial neural networks. We computed quasi-classical trajectory calculations of molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities as a function of the initial impact energy of the molecules and surface temperature, by comparing our results with available supersonic molecular beam experimental data for normal incidence. Concerning the general dependence of the molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities on the initial translational energy of the molecules, our theoretical results agree with experiments. Also in agreement with experiments, we have found that dissociative adsorption is not affected by surface temperature between 50 and 400 K, for impact energies for which the dissociation probability is larger than $\sim 10^{-3}$. We have investigated the influence of impact energy and surface temperature on the final state of the dissociation products by extending the time integration of the reactive trajectories up to 10 ps. We have found that above $\sim 2.5$ eV and close to or above room temperature, CO$_2$ dissociation induces strong surface distortions including final structures involving Cu adatoms. The creation of Cu vacancy-adatom pairs is stimulated by the presence of both CO$_{ads}$ and O$_{ads}$ which interact strongly with the Cu adatoms and even give rise to unexpected (O-Cu-CO)$_{ads}$ linear moieties anchored to the surface by the dissociated O atom and involving a Cu adatom almost detached from the surface. These surface distortions produced by dissociation products of high energy CO$_2$ molecules at and above room temperature might explain recent experiments that have found a greater saturation oxygen coverage for high energy molecules.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relative importance of electronic and phononic energy dissipation during the molecular adsorption of CO on Cu(110). Initial sticking probabilities as a function of impact energy for CO impinging at normal incidence at a surface temperature of 90 K were computed using classical trajectory simulations. To this aim, we use a full-dimensional potential energy surface constructed using an atomistic neural network trained on density functional theory data obtained with the nonlocal vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional. Two models are compared: one allowing only energy transfer and dissipation from the molecule to lattice vibrations, and the other also incorporating the effect of molecular energy loss due to the excitation of electron-hole pairs, modeled within the local-density friction approximation. Our results reveal, firstly, that the molecule mainly transfers energy to lattice vibrations, and this channel determines the adsorption probabilities, with electronic friction playing a minor role. Secondly, once the molecule is trapped near the surface (where electronic density is higher), electron-hole pair excitations accelerate energy dissipation, significantly promoting CO thermalization. Still, the faster energy dissipation when electron-hole pair excitations are accounted for accelerates the accommodation of the adsorbed molecules in the chemisorption well but does not significantly alter their lateral displacements over the surface.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is essential for their application in magnonics and hybrid quantum platforms. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the vdW ferromagnet 1T-CrTe_{2} and demonstrate their systematic tunability via niobium (Nb) substitution in Cr_{1-x}Nb_{x}Te_{2}(x=0-0.2). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy reveals that Nb doping enables wide-band tuning of the resonance frequency from 40 GHz down to the few-GHz regime, accompanied by a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping constant from ~0.066 to ~0.14, while preserving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. Complementary magnetometry shows a concurrent reduction of the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization with increasing Nb content. Density functional theory calculations attribute the observed spin-dynamic trends to Nb-induced modifications of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, CrTe_{2} flakes (~100nm thick) exhibit lower resonance frequencies than bulk crystals, consistent with thickness-dependent magnetic anisotropy. These results establish Nb-doped CrTe_{2} as a tunable vdW ferromagnet with controllable spin dynamics, extending its functionality from spintronics to broadband magnonics and quantum magnonics.

Abstract: Copper selenide is an exceptional quasi-layered monolithic material that exhibits both semiconducting and metallic properties in adjacent visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges. Here we introduce a thiol-free colloidal synthesis for generating quasi-2D klockmannite copper selenide nanocrystals via hot injection method, achieving shape control by tuning the injection temperature and precursor concentrations without any additional ligands. This approach produces large klockmannite nanosheets with lateral sizes from 200 nm to several micrometres, as well as uniform triangular nanoplatelets with sizes of 12-25 nm that are monocrystalline and display strong NIR plasmonic absorption. The spectral features of the anisotropic klockmannite phase in the NIR have been analysed using complex-scaled discrete dipole approximation (CSDDA) calculations, which reveal pronounced optical anisotropy and the emergence of hyperbolic regime. The combined effect of propagating and evanescent fields is regarded as the underlying reason of such modes in the hyperbolic domain. Finally, the ultrafast photophysical behaviour of the material in klockmannite phase is examined, including hot-hole cooling, trapping, and coherent phonons generation. Our findings emphasize the important role of the intrinsic crystal anisotropy in governing the physical properties of nanoscale klockmannite.

Abstract: The symmetric Heisenberg exchange interaction and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are parts of the tensor potential describing effective spin-spin interaction caused by the superexchange interaction of magnetic ions via nonmagnetic ion. There is the Keffer form of the vector constant of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which includes the shift of the nonmagnetic ion (ligand) from the line connecting two magnetic ions. It is suggested, in this paper, that the ligand shift can give contribution in the constant of the symmetric Heisenberg interaction in antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials. Hence, the constant of the Heisenberg interaction is composed minimum of two terms. One does not depend on the ligand shift an gives standard contribution in the energy density like term with no derivatives of the spin densities or term containing two spatial derivatives of the spin densities. It is demonstrated that additional term gives a term in the energy density containing one spatial derivative of the spin density. Corresponding contribution in the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation is found. Possibility of the noncollinear equilibrium order of spin under influence of new spin torque is discussed. Modification of the spin wave (normal modes) dispersion dependencies in the antiferromagnetic materials is found for the collinear order and for the cycloidal order of spins. Effective spin current is derived and applied for the spin-current model of the polarization origin in multiferroics.

Motivation: 在理想（无无序）系统中，铁磁极化子导致的磁阻效应有限（约20-30%）。本研究旨在探究结构无序如何影响极化子的形成及其磁阻特性，特别是希望能找到最大化磁阻效应的条件。

Method: 研究者通过理论建模与分析，探讨了不同程度的结构无序（钉扎中心）对铁磁极化子形成、电阻率和磁阻的影响。他们构建了一个以“耦合强度”和“无序程度”为变量的磁阻图谱，并将已知的磁性半导体材料定位在该框架中进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，结构无序能促进极化子的形成，并显著提高居里温度（Tc）附近的电阻率。适度的无序可以将磁阻效应从约20-30%大幅提升至约80%。然而，这种增强效应并非线性，过度的无序会导致系统转变为对磁场不敏感的安德森绝缘体，从而抑制磁阻。论文最终确定了能够最大化磁阻效应的最佳无序水平。

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了结构无序在调控铁磁极化子磁阻效应中的关键双重作用。通过找到最佳无序条件，可以显著增强材料的磁阻特性，这为设计和优化磁性半导体材料提供了重要的理论框架和指导。

Abstract: Ferromagnetic polarons are self trapped states of an electron in a locally spin polarised environment. They occur close to the magnetic $T_c$ in low carrier density local moment magnets when the electron-spin coupling is comparable to the hopping scale. In non disordered systems the primary signatures are a modest non-monotonicity in the temperature dependent resistivity $ρ(T)$, and a magnetoresistance that can be $\sim 20-30 \%$ at $T_c$, at fields that, in energy units, are $\sim 0.01 k_BT_c$. We find that structural disorder, in the form of pinning centers, promotes polaron formation, hugely increases the resistivity peak at $T_c$, and can enhance the magnetoresistance to $\sim 80\%$. The change in magnetoresistance with disorder is, however, non-monotonic. Too much disorder just creates an Anderson insulator - with the resistivity unresponsive to the magnetisation. This paper establishes the optimum disorder for maximising the magnetoresistance, suggests the physical process behind the unusual disorder dependence, and provides a magnetoresistance map - in terms of coupling and disorder - that locates some of the existing magnetic semiconductors within this framework.

Abstract: The triangular Hofstadter-Hubbard model, realizable in moiré bilayers, provides a fertile ground for discovering correlated topological states. We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $δ$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$δ$ phase diagram. Our work demonstrates robust chiral superconductivity in the thermodynamic limit through doping Chern insulator and CSL.

TL;DR: 这篇综述指出，在铜氧化物高温超导体的研究中，长程库仑相互作用和等离激元效应至关重要。作者通过分层t-J-V模型解释了相关实验现象，并提出这可能是解开多层材料比单层材料超导温度更高之谜的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的t-J模型不足以解释铜氧化物超导体中的电荷动力学，特别是长程库仑相互作用的效应。此外，一个长期存在的谜题是，为何含有多个CuO2单元层的多层铜氧化物，其超导临界温度（Tc）总是高于单层或双层材料。这篇综述旨在为这些问题提供一个新视角。

Method: 本文提出并使用“分层t-J-V模型”，该模型在标准t-J模型的基础上，加入了长程库仑相互作用（V）和材料的分层结构。作者将此模型的理论预测与共振非弹性X射线散射（RIXS）的实验数据进行比较，并回顾了自旋涨落（spin-fluctuation）机制。

Result: 1. 分层t-J-V模型能很好地描述实验观察到的电荷动力学。
2. 即使准粒子谱权重被显著抑制，电子色散中也没有出现尖锐的“扭折”（kink）。
3. 电荷涨落是赝能隙（pseudogap）形成的关键，但不是其全部原因。
4. 光学等离激元会产生一种名为“等离激子”（plasmarons）的准粒子，形成一个非相干的复制能带。
5. 传统的自旋涨落超导机制存在“自我抑制效应”，而屏蔽库仑相互作用对于实现高温超导至关重要。

Conclusion: 考虑等离激元（plasmon）效应和长程库仑相互作用的三维理论方法，为解释为何多层铜氧化物比单层具有更高的超导临界温度这一长期难题，提供了新的关键线索。为了准确描述铜氧化物并实现高温超导，必须将屏蔽库仑相互作用纳入理论模型。

Abstract: In this review, we first present compelling evidence from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data that highlights the significance of the long-range Coulomb interaction in cuprate charge dynamics, particularly around the in-plane momentum q=(0,0). We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure.
  This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band.
  We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts. Finally, we review the spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity suffers from the "self-restraint effect" and show how important the screened Coulomb interaction is in the spin-fluctuation mechanism to realize high-Tc superconductivity.

Abstract: Chiral magnetic states give rise to rich phenomena, from the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear electrical current to multiferroics and magnetochiral dichroism. Most of the studies on electrical transport so far have focused on the cases where the magnetic moments are well approximated by classical local moments. Here, we reveal that the coexistence of quantum fluctuations and chiral spin correlations gives rise to a $\log(T)$ temperature dependence in the electrical magnetochiral effect, a nonreciprocal response. Using the Green's function method and a scattering theory approach, we show that the $\log(T)$ temperature dependence occurs through a scattering process similar to that of the Kondo effect. The electrical magnetochiral effect is sensitive to the sign of vector spin chirality and the magnetic field. The results demonstrate that local spin correlations and quantum fluctuations cooperatively induce nontrivial properties in transport phenomena.

Abstract: We review recent theoretical progress on the charge dynamics of doped carriers in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Advances in this field have clarified that doped charges in cuprates exhibit remarkably rich collective behavior, governed by the combined effects of strong electronic correlations, the intrinsic layered crystal structure, and long-range Coulomb interaction. First, the emergence of acousticlike plasmons has been firmly established through quantitative analyses of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra based on the t-J-V model -- an extension of the conventional t-J model that incorporates the layered crystal structure and the long-range Coulomb interaction V. These acousticlike plasmons arise near the in-plane momentum q=(0,0) and possess characteristic energies far below the well-known ~ 1 eV optical plasmon. This behavior is found to be universal across both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, including multilayer systems. Second, in electron-doped cuprates, a pronounced tendency toward d-wave bond-charge order develops near q=(0.5pi, 0), as revealed by resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) and RIXS. As a result, the charge dynamics acquires a dual structure, in which low-energy bond-charge excitations coexist with relatively high-energy plasmons. Third, analogous signatures of charge-order tendency have also been reported in hole-doped cuprates. However, a direct application of the d-wave bond-charge-order framework fails to account for experimental observations. Similarly, the charge-stripe order in La-based cuprates remains unresolved within existing theoretical approaches. Assuming that mobile carriers behave in a largely universal manner across electron- and hole-doped systems, we discuss a possible scenario that may reconcile these diverse experimental findings.

Abstract: Nonvolatile control of the Mott transition is a central goal in correlated-electron physics, offering access to fascinating emergent states and great potential for technological applications. Compared to chemical or mechanical approaches, ultrafast optical excitation further promises a path to create and manipulate novel non-equilibrium phases with ultimate spatiotemporal precision. However, achieving a truly nonvolatile electronic phase transition in laser-excited Mott systems remains an elusive challenge. Here, we present a highly robust and reversible method for optical control of the Mott state in van der Waals systems. Specifically, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in the ultrafast laser-excited charge density wave (CDW) material 1T-TaSe2. Complementary theoretical calculations reveal that this transition originates from a rearrangement of the interlayer CDW stacking. This new stacking order, formed following the ultrafast quenching of the CDW, circumvents the need for large-scale atomic sliding. Intriguingly, it introduces a significant in-plane component to the electron hopping and effectively reduces the ratio of on-site Coulomb interaction to bandwidth, thereby suppressing the Mott state and stabilizing a metallic phase. Our results establish optical-control of interlayer stacking as a versatile strategy for inducing nonvolatile phase transitions, opening a new route to tailor correlated electronic phases and realize reconfigurable high-frequency devices.

Motivation: 传统的密度泛函理论（DFT）在处理强关联系统时常常失效。量子嵌入（QE）理论虽能解决此问题，但其核心步骤——求解嵌入哈密尔顿量（EH）——计算成本极高，构成了主要瓶颈。

Method: 作者引入了一个用于QE的线性基础模型。该模型使用主成分分析（PCA）来压缩求解嵌入哈密尔顿量（EH）所需的量子态空间，将其简化为一个较小变分空间内的确定性基态本征值问题。通过数据驱动的主动学习方案，模型从EH的基态中学习这个子空间。

Result: 在一个晶格上学习到的变分空间可以无需额外训练直接迁移到其他类型的晶格。在对金属钚的验证中，单个变分空间成功再现了其所有六个晶相的能量学，同时将EH的求解成本降低了数个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法为克服量子嵌入（QE）框架的主要计算瓶颈提供了一条实用路径，为以接近DFT的成本对强关联材料进行高通量第一性原理模拟铺平了道路。

Abstract: Simulations of quantum matter rely mainly on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), which often fails for strongly correlated systems. Quantum embedding (QE) theories address this limitation by mapping the system onto an auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) describing fragment-environment interactions, but the EH is typically large and its iterative solution is the primary computational bottleneck. We introduce a linear foundation model for QE that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the space of quantum states needed to solve the EH within a small variational subspace. Using a data-driven active-learning scheme, we learn this subspace from EH ground states and reduce each embedding solve to a deterministic ground-state eigenvalue problem in the reduced space. Within the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (ghost-GA), we show for a three-orbital Hubbard model that a variational space learned on a Bethe lattice is transferable to square and cubic lattices without additional training, while substantially reducing the cost of the EH step. We further validate the approach on plutonium, where a single variational space reproduces the energetics of all six crystalline phases while reducing the cost of the EH solution by orders of magnitude. This provides a practical route to overcome the main computational bottleneck of QE frameworks, paving the way for high-throughput ab initio simulations of strongly correlated materials at a near-DFT cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为时变涨落局域场（TD-FLF）的新方法，用于模拟关联费米子动力学。该方法计算成本低且结果准确，在模拟驱动关联系统中展现了巨大潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟关联费米子系统的动力学（尤其是受驱动的系统）非常复杂。现有的方法要么计算成本过高，要么精度不足。因此，需要一种兼具低计算成本和高精度的有效方法。

Method: 本文将静态的涨落局域场（FLF）方法扩展到了含时（time-dependent）情况，提出了TD-FLF方法。该方法将多体波函数近似为一组在经典涨落场中演化的非相互作用态的系综，并将系统的动力学信息编码到该场的时变分布中。通过这种方式，复杂的含时薛定谔方程被简化为一个在显著缩小的基组中的广义本征值问题。

Result: 在半填充的二维Hubbard格子上进行测试，TD-FLF方法取得了高精度的结果。其性能超越了传统的平均场理论，计算出的振荡频率和振幅与精确对角化的结果高度吻合。

Conclusion: TD-FLF方法因其较低的计算成本和灵活性，成为一个用于模拟驱动关联电子系统动力学的非常有前途的工具。

Abstract: We formulate a time-dependent Fluctuating Local Field (TD-FLF) method for correlated fermion dynamics, extending the stationary FLF approach. The wavefunction is approximated as an ensemble of non-interacting states subject to a classical fluctuating field, with dynamics encoded in the field's time-dependent distribution. This reduces the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to a generalized eigenvalue problem in a significantly reduced basis. Applied to half-filled 2D Hubbard lattices, TD-FLF yields highly accurate results, outperforming mean-field theory and capturing oscillation frequencies and amplitudes in good agreement with exact diagonalization. Its low computational cost and flexibility make TD-FLF a promising tool for simulating driven correlated systems.

Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a one-dimensional spin quantum breakdown model, which has an exponential $U(1)$ symmetry with charge unit decaying as $2^{-j}$ with site position $j$. By exact diagonalization (ED), we show that the model with spin $S\ge2$ exhibits an exponential $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase dubbed a quantum breakdown condensate. It exhibits a bulk gap violating the Goldstone theorem, and an edge mode only on the left edge if in open boundary condition. In a length $L$ lattice, the condensate has $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of SSB ground states originating from the $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of exponential $U(1)$ charge sectors, leading to a finite entropy density $\ln 2$. This enforces a first order SSB phase transition into this phase, as observed in ED and verified in the large $S$ limit on an exactly solvable Rokhsar-Kivelson line. The condensate has an SSB order parameter being the local in-plane spin, which points in angles related by the chaotic Bernoulli (dyadic) map and thus is effectively random. Moreover, we show the condensate exhibits non-decaying local autocorrelations, and does not have an off-diagonal long-range order. The quantum breakdown condensate thus behaves as a disorder-free quantum glass and is beyond the existing classifications of phases of matter.

Abstract: A variety of distinct anisotropic exchange interactions commonly exist in one magnetic material due to complex crystal, magnetic and orbital symmetries. Here we investigate the effects of multiple anisotropic exchange interactions on topological magnon in a honeycomb ferromagnet, and find a chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by a complicated interplay of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), accompanied by the bulk gap close and reopen with chiral inversion. Moreover, this novel topological phase transition involves band inversion at high symmetry points $K$ and $K'$, which can be regarded as a pseudo-orbital reversal, i.e. magnon valley degree of freedom, implying a new manipulation corresponding to a sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. Indeed, it can be realized in 4$d$ or 5$d$ correlated materials with both spin-orbit coupling and orbital localized states, such as iridates and ruthenates, etc. This novel regulation may have potential applications on magnon devices and topological magnonics.

Abstract: In metal-insulator transition materials, a small perturbation can shift the delicate balance between competing or coexisting electronic phases, leading to dramatic changes of the material's properties. Using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, a prototypical metal-insulator transition manganite, we show that local low-dose focused ion beam irradiation increases resistivity by several orders of magnitude, converting the ferromagnetic-metal ground state into a paramagnetic-insulator. Surprisingly, we found that applying electric stimuli to the irradiated material induces a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition, which results in low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that this voltage-induced metallic phase in the irradiated material is ferromagnetic, exhibiting clear anisotropic magnetoresistance. This work, thus, reports the discovery of a unique material in which the electrical triggering of the electronic phase transition results in the onset of magnetism, in stark contrast to the magnetic order suppression commonly observed in other metal-insulator transition switching materials. We demonstrate that local focused ion beam irradiation provides new and exciting opportunities to engineer electronic and magnetic functionalities that can find practical applications ranging from spintronics to neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: The heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh2As2 exhibits a non-superconducting phase transition that precedes the emergence of superconductivity. The nature of the corresponding order parameter remains under debate, with competing proposals involving magnetic dipoles or electric quadrupoles. We derive the momentum-dependent multipolar susceptibilities and effective interactions among the localized 4f electrons, based on the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Magnetic fluctuations within the crystalline-electric-field (CEF) ground-state doublet are dominated by q=(1/2,1/2,0), corresponding to a two-dimensional checkerboard configuration of the magnetic moment M_z along the c axis. Hybridization between the CEF ground state and the first-excited doublet gives rise to leading magnetic octupole fluctuations of z(x^2-y^2) symmetry, followed by electric quadrupole fluctuations of x^2-y^2 and {yz, zx} symmetries. By taking into account the anisotropic magnetic-field dependence of the transition temperature T_0, we conclude that an antiferromagnetic order of M_z at q=(1/2,1/2,0) is consistent with the experiments, owing to the enhancement of T_0 caused by fluctuations of the field-induced quadrupole of {yz, zx} type under an in-plane magnetic field.

Abstract: X-ray circular dichroism (XCD), defined as the difference in absorption or scattering intensity between X-rays of opposite polarizations, arises from the breaking of spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry and is thus sensitive to chirality, magnetism, and their interplay. Non-reciprocal XCD, in which the dichroic response changes upon reversing the propagation direction of the probe, is generally forbidden in systems with both symmetries. Using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we identify circularly polarized phonons in ferro-rotational MnTiO$_3$, which we term ferro-rotational phonons. Their excitations provide a direct demonstration of non-reciprocal XCD in a system that globally preserves inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose that a condensate of these phonons, manifested as standing waves, underlies the ferro-rotational order in MnTiO$_3$. The interplay among photon helicity, phonon polarization, and the axial ferro-rotational order gives rise to the observed non-reciprocal circular dichroism.

Motivation: 超导二极管有望实现无耗散的整流效应，但现有本征平台的效率都非常低。研究者希望揭示造成这种低效率的根本原因。

Method: 1. 采用不依赖于微观细节的基本热力学和通用朗道理论进行分析。
2. 推导了二极管效率（用反向与正向临界电流之比ε表示）的下限。
3. 使用一个最小的“超导体-伊辛模型”来具体展示和验证他们的理论。

Result: 1. 完美二极管效应（ε=0）在没有精确微调的情况下是不可能实现的。
2. 高效率（ε→0）只可能在超导态内部的临界点上实现。
3. 在远离这些临界点时，效率ε存在一个理论下限，限制了其性能。
4. 在连续相变临界点附近，效率ε的标度行为与已知的临界指数相关联。

Conclusion: 本征超导二极管的低效率源于基本的热力学限制。这项工作为理解和设计高效超导二极管提供了理论框架，指出未来的研究方向应集中在探索和调控超导态内部的临界点。

Abstract: Superconducting diodes promise dissipation-less rectification, yet intrinsic platforms invariably have very low efficiencies. We reveal a fundamental thermodynamic origin of this behavior that is independent of microscopic details. Denoting $ε= I_c^-/I_c^+$, where $I_c^\pm$ are critical current magnitudes in opposite directions with $I_c^+>I_c^-$ by convention, we show that $ε=0$ is impossible without fine-tuning, while $ε\to0$ can occur but only upon tuning to a critical point \emph{within} the superconducting state. Away from such internal instabilities, using general Landau theory, we derive a lower bound on $ε$ that limits intrinsic diode performance. We illustrate these ideas in a minimal superconductor-Ising model, where the strong nonreciprocity can be seen explicitly. In particular, if the internal transition is continuous, we show that the scaling of $ε$ near the transition is locked to known critical exponents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一套在超导体-磁性材料-超导体结中实现电荷和自旋约瑟夫森二极管效应的必要条件。核心在于利用磁性材料的非共面自旋结构打破对称性，从而导致非对称的电流-相位关系。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在由自旋单态超导体和强自旋极化非均匀磁性材料组成的异质结构中，产生电荷和自旋约瑟夫森二极管效应的基本物理条件。

Method: 通过理论分析一个特定的约瑟夫森结，该结由夹在两个自旋单态超导体之间的强自旋极化非均匀磁性材料（FM）构成。研究人员分析了由FM的非共面自旋织构产生的量子几何相位如何影响约瑟夫森电流-相位关系（CPR）。他们还构建了一个最小唯象模型来定性地说明其理论。

Result: 研究发现，要出现二极管效应，必须满足以下几个必要条件：1. 磁性材料的自旋织构需为非共面，以打破空间反演对称性。2. 两个自旋带都必须对输运有贡献（即结不能是半金属的）。3. 需要不同的能带密度态。4. CPR中必须存在高次谐波。即使在隧穿极限下，也需满足特定量子几何相位的限制条件。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，当电流-相位关系（CPR）不具备相位反演中心时，电荷和自旋约瑟夫森二极管效应就会出现。该研究系统地阐述了实现这一目标所需的物理条件，为实验上实现这些量子二极管效应提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We present a set of necessary conditions for the appearance of charge and spin Josephson diode effects across strongly spin-polarized inhomogeneous magnetic materials (FM) placed between two spin-singlet superconductors. Noncoplanarity of the FM's spin texture gives rise to quantum geometric phases, $Δ\varphi'$, that enter the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR) similarly to the superconducting phase difference, resulting in charge and spin Josephson diode effects. Our study shows that such effects appear if the CPR possesses no phase-inversion center, achieved under the following conditions. First, noncoplanarity of the spin texture is necessary to break the spatial inversion symmetry. Second, both spin bands have to contribute to the transport, i.e., the effect is absent in half-metallic junctions. Third, different band-specific densities of states are required, and this condition is ensured by the strong spin polarization of the FM. Finally, higher harmonics in the CPR are necessary, i.e., the effect is absent in the tunneling limit. However, even in this case, the CPR must not have a phase-inversion center, which is ensured by the restriction of the quantum geometric phase to values $Δ\varphi'\neq kπ/2, k\in\mathbb{Z}$. We formulate a minimal phenomenological model that incorporates all these points, qualitatively illustrating our theory.

Abstract: We present a detailed numerical investigation of semi-inclusive forward di-hadron production in proton-nucleus collisions employing the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. We focus on the regime where di-hadrons are produced nearly back-to-back in the transverse plane, thereby justifying a transverse-momentum-dependent factorization approach in terms of small-$x$ gluon distributions. Our computation integrates several key elements: i) non-linear rapidity evolution via the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with running coupling, ii) both perturbative and non-perturbative Sudakov resummation, and iii) a phenomenologically constrained model for the initial conditions for small-$x$ gluon distributions. We compare this phenomenological framework to experimental data from the STAR Collaboration on azimuthal correlations in forward di-pion production in both proton-proton and proton-gold collisions. We analyze the systematic theoretical uncertainties associated with the saturation scales of nuclei at the initial scale for rapidity evolution and with those associated with the hadronization process. Finally, we make predictions for the kinematics anticipated to be covered by the ALICE Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) upgrade at the Large Hadron Collider.

TL;DR: 研究人员提出一种新型探测器方案（TES阵列），既作为放射源又作为探测器，来寻找一种非常罕见的原子核（$^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta）衰变。该方法比传统方法更灵敏，不仅有望首次测量其衰变半衰期，还能用于寻找特定类型的暗物质。


<details>

Motivation: 这项研究的动机是寻找并测量长寿命同核异构体 $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ 的退激发过程，这是一个长期存在的核物理学难题。同时，该实验装置的高灵敏度也可用于寻找由暗物质引发的退激发事件。

Method: 我们提出一种“源即探测器”的搜索方法，使用一个伽马射线转换边缘传感器（TES）阵列来寻找天然钽中长寿命同核异构体 $^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta 的退激发。该方法利用了两种新技术：一是通过量热法测量每次事件沉积在吸收体中的总能量；二是通过后续 $^{180}$Ta 到 $^{180}$Hf 的电子俘获（EC）衰变进行延迟符合标记。

Result: 基于背景模型的模拟结果显示，一个拥有256像素的TES阵列可在2.6年内达到理论预期的内部转换（IC）半衰期，而1000像素的阵列仅需0.66年。对于一个拥有一万像素并运行五年的更大阵列，其对暗物质诱导退激发的探测灵敏度将超越当前所有实验的限制，并能探索新的参数空间。

Conclusion: 我们提出的基于TES阵列的“源即探测器”方法，对于测量 $^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta 的内部转换半衰期以及寻找特定类型的暗物质具有巨大潜力，其灵敏度远超现有技术。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $γ$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3σ$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$~yr and $0.66$~yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文重新审视了希格斯微子（higgsino）暗物质，发现在与轻子（slepton）共湮灭的情况下，即使考虑了最新的LZ-2024实验约束，其质量仍可低至500 GeV。模型的有效性强烈依赖于规范子质量参数（M1和M2）的符号，其中符号相反的配置因能有效逃避直接探测而依然可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的纯希格斯微子（higgsino）暗物质模型需要约1.1 TeV的高质量才能满足观测到的热遗迹丰度。作者旨在探究通过引入轻子（slepton）的共湮灭过程，是否可以显著降低这一质量要求，并评估最新的直接探测实验结果（如LZ-2024）对这些轻质量情景施加的约束。

Method: 该研究在最小超对称标准模型（MSSM）的框架内进行，重点研究了希格斯微子（higgsino）与轻子（slepton）共湮灭的情景。作者将他们的理论预测与最新的直接探测实验（特别是LZ-2022和LZ-2024）的约束条件进行对比，并分析了规范子质量参数（M1和M2）的相对符号如何影响结果。

Result: 研究发现，有效的轻子（slepton）共湮灭可以将满足遗迹密度约束的希格斯微子（higgsino）质量下限降至约400 GeV。然而，最新的直接探测更新（LZ-2022和LZ-2024）分别将这一质量下限提高到了约450 GeV和500 GeV。至关重要的是，当规范子质量参数M1和M2符号相反时（M1/M2 < 0），模型仍然广泛可行，因为破坏性干涉会抑制自旋无关散射截面；而M1和M2同为正号的情景则被LZ-2024完全排除。

Conclusion: 尽管存在来自LZ-2024的严格新约束，希格斯微子（higgsino）暗物质仍然是一个可行的候选者，特别是在存在轻子（slepton）共湮灭且规范子质量参数（M1和M2）符号相反的情况下。该论文为这些特定构型描绘了剩余的 viable 参数空间。

Abstract: The higgsino-like neutralino is a compelling dark matter candidate motivated by both cosmology and naturalness considerations. While a pure higgsino typically requires a mass of around $1.1~\mathrm{TeV}$ to satisfy the observed thermal relic abundance, the presence of light sleptons can significantly alter this requirement. In this work, we revisit higgsino dark matter within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), focusing on scenarios with slepton coannihilation. We find that efficient coannihilation allows the higgsino mass to be as light as $\sim 400~\mathrm{GeV}$ while satisfying relic density constraints. We explicitly contrast the impact of recent direct detection updates: the LZ-2022 limits raise this lower bound to approximately $450~\mathrm{GeV}$, while the stringent LZ-2024 constraints further shift the viable mass floor to $\sim 500~\mathrm{GeV}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the direct detection sensitivity is strongly dependent on the relative signs of the gaugino mass parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$. We find that scenarios with $M_1, M_2 > 0$ are fully excluded by LZ-2024. Conversely, configurations with opposite signs ($M_1/M_2 < 0$) remain broadly viable, as destructive interference in the neutralino-Higgs coupling efficiently suppresses the spin-independent cross section. Finally, we delineate the remaining viable parameter space for both the opposite-sign cases and the specific configurations with negative $M_1$ and $M_2$.

Motivation: 在超对称标准模型（MSSM）中，如何解释夸克和轻子的质量与混合模式（即味结构），并同时抑制理论预言但实验未见的危险过程——味改变中性流（FCNC），是一个长期存在的难题。

Method: 作者在一个离散 $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 对称性的基础上，通过规范其 $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 外自同构，为物质场引入了一套“不可逆选择规则”。这套规则能够生成现实的汤川耦合结构，并确保超对称破缺的软质量项是对角的，从而抑制FCNC过程。团队通过随机参数分析和重整化群演化来检验模型的有效性和稳定性。

Result: 该框架成功地再现了夸克和轻子的质量与混合数据。分析表明，所有由模型导致的味破坏过程（如 $μ	o e γ$ 和介子混合）的速率都在当前实验允许的范围之内。此外，模型的关键结构在重整化群演化下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 不可逆选择规则为解决超对称理论中的味物理难题提供了一个引人注目的新途径，能够统一地处理味结构和FCNC抑制这两个核心问题。

Abstract: We investigate a framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in which the quark and lepton flavor structure and suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are governed by non-invertible selection rules. By implementing such non-group-like fusion rules for matter fields, arising from gauging the outer automorphism $\mathbb{Z}_2$ of a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, we obtain realistic Yukawa textures that reproduce the observed quark and lepton masses and mixings while ensuring diagonal soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking masses and hence suppressing dangerous FCNC processes. We analyze mass insertion parameters under random $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients and find that all flavor-violating effects are consistent with experimental limits on processes such as $μ\to e γ$ and meson mixings. We show that the Yukawa textures and soft terms remain stable under renormalization group evolution. Our results demonstrate that non-invertible selection rules provide a compelling new mechanism to address both the flavor structure and FCNC problems in supersymmetric models.

Method: 我们假设X(3872)是一个紧凑的同位旋单重态四夸克，它与一个由松散束缚的粲介子组成的分子同位旋三重态的中间态混合。这种混合导致了观察到的大规模同位旋破坏。

Result: 该模型成功解释了X(3872)的大同位旋破坏。当应用于Z(3900)共振时，模型呈现出相反的模式：Z粒子被识别为紧凑的同位旋三重态，并且没有证据表明存在中性同位旋单重态Z粒子，因此预计其衰变中不会发生同位旋破坏。

Conclusion: 我们提出的模型可以解释在X(3872)衰变中观察到的强同位旋破坏。该模型预测Z(3900)衰变中不会出现同位旋破坏，这与观测结果一致。

Abstract: We propose a model explaining the strong isospin violations observed in X(3872) decays. The X is assumed to be a compact isosinglet tetraquark and its charged partners to form an isotriplet, together with an additional neutral state mixing with the isosinglet. The isotriplet results from the loose binding of open charm mesons and, in isolation, has strongly suppressed production rates. However, its neutral component can still mix with the isosinglet and induce the large isospin violations observed. The compact-isosinglet/molecular-isotriplet pattern appears reversed when the Z(3900) resonances are considered. The Z particles observed correspond to a compact isotriplet and there is no evidence of a neutral isosinglet Z. We show that no isospin violation in the Z decays is expected.

Abstract: Precise measurements of Higgs decays into quarks and gluons are essential for probing the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson and testing the flavor structure of the Standard Model. We investigate the process $e^+e^- \to ZH$ at $\sqrt{s}=240~\mathrm{GeV}$ at a future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory, taking the CEPC design as a benchmark. The analysis focuses on events with $Z\toν\barν$ and hadronic Higgs decays $H\to b\bar b$, $c\bar c$, $s\bar s$ and $gg$. Jet flavor is identified using state-of-the-art particle-level deep neural network taggers (ParticleNet, Particle Transformer and More-Interaction Particle Transformer), whose per-jet outputs are combined with global event observables in a two-stage analysis employing XGBoost classifiers to separate the four Higgs decay modes from the dominant two- and four-fermion Standard Model backgrounds. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $20\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$, we obtain projected relative precision on $σ(ZH)\times\mathrm{Br}(H\to X)$ of 0.18% for $X=b\bar b$, 1.07% for $c\bar c$, 0.52% for $gg$ and 78% for $s\bar s$. Compared with the CEPC published results, the precisions for $H\to c\bar c$ and $H\to gg$ are improved by about $42%$ and $26%$, respectively. For $H\to s\bar s$ we present a quantitative sensitivity estimation corresponding to a statistical significance of about $1.3σ$. These results highlight the potential of deep-learning-based jet flavor tagging for precision studies of Higgs decays at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories.

Motivation: 本文旨在为量子色动力学（QCD）中的偶极子密度方程寻找一个自然解，并检验在偶极子-偶极子高能散射中，产生的胶子分布是否符合Kharzeev-Levin关于熵的预测。

Method: 1. 证明Pomeron微积分中的“扇形”图是QCD偶极子密度方程的自然解。 2. 将简化的领头扭曲核的Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) 方程的解析解与t信道幺正性进行比较，以确定偶极子密度。 3. 计算大的Pomeron环路对高能偶极子-偶极子散射的贡献。 4. 应用Abramovsky, Gribov and Kancheli (AGK) 切割规则来分析产物。

Result: 研究发现，在高能散射中产生的胶子分布遵循KNO (Koba, Nielsen and Olesen) 定律。基于此分布，计算出的熵为 $S_E = \ln(x G(x,Q^2))$。

Conclusion: 本文的计算结果证实了Kharzeev和Levin的预测，即色玻璃凝聚态（CGC）的熵与部分子分布函数呈对数关系。

Abstract: It is shown in this paper that the QCD equations for dipole density have the natural solution: the 'fan' diagrams of the Pomeron calculus. We found the dipole densities comparing the analytic solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation for the simplified leading twist kernel with the $t$ channel unitarity. Using these densities we calculate the contributions of large Pomeron loops to dipole-dipole scattering at high energies. Applying the Abramovsky,Gribov and Kancheli cutting rules we found that the produced gluons are distributed accordingly the KNO (Koba, Nielsen and Olesen) law which leads to the entropy $S_E = \ln(x G(x,Q^2))$ in an agreement with Kharzeev - Levin predictions.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自洽的轻前沿夸克模型（LFQM），并应用它来统一描述K介子的电磁特性、横向动量依赖分布（TMDs）和部分子分布函数（PDFs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻前沿模型存在模糊性（如零模问题）和不统一的问题。本文旨在建立一个统一且与流分量无关的模型，以一致地描述介子的内部结构，并连接非微扰动力学与可观测的物理量。

Method: 作者采用基于Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) 构造的自洽轻前沿夸克模型（LFQM）。通过在计算中统一使用不变质量（M₀），模型保证了动量守恒，并消除了零模模糊性。他们使用高斯型的轻前沿波函数来具体计算K介子的电磁和标量形状因子、TMDs及PDFs。

Result: 该模型成功获得了与流分量无关的观测量，并通过计算电磁形状因子验证了这一点。模型展示了不同扭曲度（twist）的TMDs呈现出系统性的层级结构，并满足相关的求和规则。此外，他们还对π介子和K介子的价部分子PDFs进行了演化计算，其结果可与唯象学直接比较。

Conclusion: 基于Bakamjian-Thomas构造的轻前沿夸克模型（LFQM）为介子结构提供了一个统一、自洽且与流分量无关的描述，成功地在非微扰的轻前沿动力学和演化后的共线部分子分布函数（PDFs）之间建立了一座可靠的桥梁。

Abstract: We present a self-consistent light-front quark model (LFQM) for the kaon based on the Bakamjian--Thomas (BT) construction and apply it to the electromagnetic and scalar form factors, as well as the full set of unpolarized T-even transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) and their collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). A uniform use of the invariant mass $M_0$ in both hadronic matrix elements and Lorentz prefactors enforces four-momentum conservation at the meson--quark vertex and yields current-component--independent observables, removing light-front zero-mode ambiguities. Properly normalized electromagnetic form factor $F_{K^+}(Q^2)$ is exemplified as a current-component--independent observable by verifying its uniqueness with the explicit computation from all the available components ($γ^+$, $γ^\perp$, and $γ^-$) of the current. In the scalar channel, we compare the direct $f_S(Q^2)$ and mass-factored $F_S(Q^2)$ definitions and show they are not interchangeable within the BT-based LFQM because $M\to M_0(x,{\bf k}_\perp)$ must be implemented inside the integral. Using a Gaussian form for the light-front wave function, the twist-2 TMD $f_1^q$ becomes exactly Gaussian in ${\bf k}_\perp$, while higher-twist TMDs ($f^{\perp q}$, $e^q$, $f_4^q$) display systematic twist/flavor hierarchies, including an elliptic deformation of $f_4^q$ tied to $γ^-$ component. The BT-based LFQM satisfies the forward-limit sum rule for $f_4^q(x)$. We further analyze the perturbative QCD evolution of the valence PDFs for the pion and kaon and report their Mellin moments at representative scales, enabling direct comparison with phenomenology. Overall, the BT-based LFQM provides a unified, current-independent description of meson structure and a consistent bridge from nonperturbative light-front dynamics to evolved collinear PDFs.

Motivation: 传统的 J/ψ 产生理论模型具有内在假设和有限的运动学适用性，导致其预测结果依赖于具体模型。为了克服这些限制，本文旨在提出一种与模型无关的分析方法。

Method: 研究人员采用人工神经网络（ANN）技术，对 HERA 的独家相干衍射 J/ψ 产生数据集进行与模型无关的分析。他们训练 ANN 模型来预测在不同质心能量（W）、光子虚度（Q²）和四动量转移平方（t）下的微分截面。随后，他们将 HERA 和 LHC 的数据结合，以预测总光致产生截面并提取指数斜率 b。

Result: ANN 模型成功预测了 HERA 数据集的微分截面。通过结合 HERA 和 LHC 的数据，模型预测了总光致产生截面，并成功提取了指数斜率 b。

Conclusion: 研究发现指数斜率 b 强烈依赖于光子虚度 Q² 和质心能量 W。这表明，使用人工神经网络的无模型方法能够有效地结合不同实验的数据，并揭示了 J/ψ 产生过程中的重要物理依赖关系。

Abstract: An exclusive coherent diffractive $J/ψ$ production dataset from HERA, covering a large kinematic range in the photon virtuality $Q^2$, the squared momentum transfer $t$, and the photon-proton center-of-mass energy $W$, has been analyzed using various theoretical models with different approaches. In common model analyses, the inherent assumptions and limited kinematic applicability somewhat restrict the predictive power of the models, resulting in model-dependent prediction results. In this paper, we present our model-independent approach for the same reaction process and dataset, utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The prediction of the best ANN model for the HERA differential cross-section dataset over a range of $W$, $Q^2$, and $t$ is obtained. We then extend the ANN model by combining the HERA and LHC data at various values of $W$ to predict the total photoproduction cross-section and demonstrate how to extract the exponential slope $b$. We find that the exponential slope $b$ strongly depends on $Q^2$ and $W$.

Abstract: We compute the complete one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) for all the four-fermion operators at dimension-8 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We adopt the on-shell framework, where the RGEs are obtained from the unitarity cuts of the bubble integrals. To construct a consistent set of RGEs without redundancy, we utilize the Young Tensor amplitude/operator basis as the building blocks of the tree-level amplitudes that constitute the unitarity cuts, which incorporates the full flavor structures of the effective operators. Due to the large number of effective operators for a dimension-8 type, it is crucial to reduce the integrated cuts to the same RGE amplitude basis, which is also made possible by the algorithm in the Young Tensor method. With the Mathematica package ABC4EFT that implements the method, we obtain the full result of the dimension-8 four-fermion RGEs with the output file attached as the supplementary material.

Abstract: We investigate the potential for spontaneous CP violation in a Higgs Triplet Model extension, including a complex singlet scalar. We demonstrate that the scalar potential strictly forbids spontaneous CP violation across the entire parameter space. For a non-zero trilinear coupling $κ$, minimization conditions combined with global symmetries enforce a phase alignment that yields a real vacuum. In the singular limit $κ\to 0$, we show that the enhancement of global symmetries renders unphysical vacuum phases. Consequently, we conclude that the scalar sector of this model cannot source CP violation.

Abstract: A detailed calculation of the radiatively induced $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices is carried out in the context of flavour conserving three Higgs doublet models (3HDMs). The Type-II, lepton specific and democratic versions of the 3HDM are chosen as representative cases and the \emph{alignment limit} is adopted. We arrange the amplitudes in UV-finite and gauge-invariant subsets for a sharper understanding of the underlying one-loop structure. Factoring-in various theoretical constraints and the ones from the $h \to γγ$ signal strength and the $B \to X_s γ$ branching ratio, we compute the relevant form factors and compare them among the various 3HDM types taken. The results also indicate a sizeable increment ($\sim 100\%$) over the corresponding form factors in 2HDMs. In addition, we probe the $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices at the 14 TeV LHC using vector boson fusion (VBF). It is seen that production of $H_1^+$ via VBF and the subsequent $H_1^+ \to H_2^+ H_2/A_2$ decays can have $σ\times \text{BR}$ in the $\mathcal{O}$(0.1 fb) ball park. Therefore, such a cascade can shed light on the strength of the $H_1^+ W^- Z$ interaction and confirm the presence of two charged scalars thereby acting as a smoking gun signal of a 3HDM.

Abstract: We present a machine-learning method for the nonparametric extraction of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from Compton form factors (CFFs) constrained by experimental data. The method addresses the longstanding inverse problem posed by the principal-value (PV) linear integral transform with a singular kernel that relates the charge-conjugation-even (C-even) quark GPD $H^{(+)}$ to the real part of the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) amplitude. Our approach constructs a differentiable representation of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) PV kernel and embeds it as a fixed, physics-preserving layer inside a neural network that parameterizes the GPD $H^{(+)}(x,ξ,t,Q^{2})$ itself. The model enforces exact oddness in $x$, implements endpoint suppression, and includes curvature-based regularization that stabilizes the inversion in kinematically ill-conditioned regions. A Monte Carlo ensemble of CFFs, obtained from a global neural-network fit to unpolarized DVCS measurements with propagated experimental uncertainties, serves as input to a replica ensemble of GPD networks, yielding a fully probabilistic extraction of $H^{(+)}$ over the phase space. We demonstrate the method using a global determination of $\mathrm{Re}\,\mathcal{H}$ for Jefferson Lab measurements, and present a direct neural-network reconstruction of three-dimensional GPD surfaces $H^{(+)}(x_{0},ξ,t,Q_{0}^{2})$ obtained from experimental CFF inputs. This work establishes a flexible, scalable, and model-independent strategy for extracting multidimensional hadronic structure from current and future DVCS data and other GPD-related processes.

Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration indicate that no $Λ_c\barΣ_c$ bound-state with a mass near threshold in the range $4715$--$4735~\mathrm{MeV}$ was observed. In order to determine the plausible mass region of the bound states in this structure, we calculate the mass spectrum of the $Λ_c\barΣ_c$ molecular configuration with the method of QCD sum rules. Two linearly independent interpolating currents are constructed, and contributions from nonperturbative condensates up to dimension 12 are included in the numerical results. Consequently, we obtain the masses of the candidate bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$. Our results show that the central values of the $Λ_c\barΣ_c$ bound-state masses lie around the $5.8~\mathrm{GeV}$ region, consistent with the findings reported by the BESIII Collaboration. Furthermore, we compute the mass spectrum of the $Λ_b\barΣ_b$ bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$, which could be served as hidden-bottom candidates in the experimental detecting.

Abstract: We have realized different two-zero textures within the framework of the left right symmetric model using the $Γ_{3}\cong A_{4}$ modular group. The matter multiplets of the model are assigned as three singlet representations of the $A_{4}$ group, and their charge assignments together with the modular weights of the Yukawa couplings are chosen in such a way that different two-zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix are obtained. In total, we have successfully realized seven different two-zero textures. Furthermore, we have studied neutrinoless double beta decay and lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes, and have calculated the effective Majorana mass and the branching ratios for LFV processes for each of the textures. We further probe these two-zero textures at the long-baseline neutrino experiments DUNE and T2HK. We find that DUNE, especially when combined with T2HK, can significantly restrict the $θ_{23}-δ_{\rm CP}$ parameter space predicted by these textures. Moreover, the inclusion of high-precision determinations of $θ_{12}$ (from JUNO) and $θ_{13}$ leads to a substantial, further reduction of the allowed parameter space. For assumed inverted mass ordering, the synergy of DUNE and T2HK leads to a highly predictive scenario for the $B_{2}$ and $B_{4}$ textures, as the allowed regions collapse into tiny islands near the CP-conserving points in the lower and higher octant of $θ_{23}$, respectively.

Abstract: The ground state of low-energy QCD matter in strong magenetic fields is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), a periodic array of neutral pion domain walls (chiral solitons) perpendicular to the magnetic field, or domain-wall Skyrmion phase, in which Skyrmions are induced on top of the CSL. Previously found domain-wall Skyrmions are bosons with the baryon number two. In this paper, we show that the minimum domain-wall Skyrmions are fermions with the baryon number one; a bosonic domain-wall Skyrmion can be separated without cost of energy into two fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions attached on the opposite sides of a chiral soliton. The phase boundary between the CSL and domain-wall Skyrmion phases is unchanged. In the chiral limit, the CSL reduces to a linearly dependent neutral pion on the direction of the magnetic field, while fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions sit in an equal distance of a half period.

Abstract: In this work, we study the search for charged Higgs bosons in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model plus an additional pseudo-scalar (2HDM+a) at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). Focusing on the pair production of charged Higgs bosons, followed by the decays $H^\pm \to a W $ and $ H^\mp \to t b $, we analyze the signal channel of $4j+2b+E_T^{miss}$. Given the center-of-mass energy of CLIC as $ \sqrt{s} = 1500$ GeV, charged Higgs bosons with masses $ m_{H^\pm} < \sqrt{s}/2$ are explored. Simulation results indicate that the signal significance of 400 GeV and 600 GeV charged Higgs bosons can reach $5σ$ in specific parameter spaces, and the $2σ$ exclusion limits in the $m_{H^\pm}- m_a$ plane are presented for $m_{H^\pm}$ in the range of [400, 650] GeV.

Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the fully charm tetraquark states, particularly incorporating contributions from internal gluon radiations. The paper first presents analytical expressions for the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to the decay amplitudes of fully charm tetraquarks into two photons. It is found that the QCD corrections are significant for the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process, whereas they are relatively small for the $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process. Subsequently, by considering photon-photon fusion in ultra-peripheral high-energy collisions of protons and nuclei and in electron-positron collision processes, we provide theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of fully-charm tetraquark states. The results presented in this work regarding the electromagnetic production and decay of fully charm tetraquarks shall be tested in current and future experiments.

Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of the viable baryogenesis parameter space of a non-minimal Higgs sector consisting of two Higgs doublets and a singlet pseudoscalar (2HDM$+a$). In such a model, an early Universe period of transient CP violation may occur, driven by a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the CP-odd scalar $a$. This naturally avoids the stringent electric dipole moment experimental constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of CP violation. We provide a state-of-art computation of the baryon asymmetry, providing several important improvements over existing baryogenesis computations for this model. We show that the required thermal history and successful baryogenesis lead to a predictive scenario, testable in the near future by a combination of LHC searches and low-energy flavour measurements. Our improved predictions for the baryon asymmetry find that it is rather suppressed compared to earlier predictions, requiring larger mixing between the singlet and 2HDM pseudoscalars and hence leading to a more easily testable model at colliders.

Abstract: We present a concise survey of the running of gauge couplings in realistic models of gauge-Higgs grand unification in a slice of AdS$_5$ space and investigate their potential unification. Besides unifying the gauge groups of the Standard Model, these models can address various unresolved puzzles, such as the lightness of the Higgs boson and the strong hierarchies within fermion masses and mixings, as well as provide a common origin of the gauge symmetries and the sector that spontaneously breaks them. At the same time, they furnish interesting LHC signatures in the form of TeV-scale resonances of the $X,Y$-like bosons, providing a trace of the grand-unified group, accessible at low energies. Using the method of Planck-brane correlators allows us to evolve the couplings consistently from the electroweak scale up to the Planck scale, avoiding shortcomings of other frequently-used approaches and including the effects of bulk scalars, fermions, and gauge-bosons within a common framework. We thereby revisit, contrast, and supplement results in the literature, the latter for example by including brane masses and the gauge-Higgs vacuum expectation value. Moreover, in a phenomenology section, we apply our results to the concrete case of Georgi-Glashow-like unification with a SU(6) $\supset$ SU(5) symmetry in the 5D bulk, presenting a quantitative survey of the quality of unification. We find that grand unification is possible in such models in the presence of moderately large brane kinetic terms.

We consider the complete set of effective operators up to dimension 6, and examine a few additional dimension 7 operators that contain interesting field content or potential collider signals. The lepton-gluon portal allows access to exotic states with an interesting range of SU(3) and SU(2) quantum numbers. Finally, we explore potential single-production modes and their phenomenological signatures at colliders.

Motivation: 为了在相对论尺度下模拟强电磁场引发的原子内电子动力学，这需要巨大的计算能力。因此，需要开发一种能够充分利用现代异构高性能计算系统（特别是NVIDIA和AMD的GPU）能力的新工具。

Method: 研究人员开发了名为GaDE的求解器，它结合使用MPI与CUDA/HIP技术，从而可以同时兼容NVIDIA和AMD的GPU架构。该方法将大部分计算任务放在GPU上执行，并利用“GPU-aware MPI”特性来优化节点间的通信性能。

Result: 单GPU性能测试显示，AMD MI250X与NVIDIA A100表现相当，而GH200性能更高。在LUMI超级计算机上的扩展性测试表明，GaDE在2048个GPU上的弱扩展性测试中达到了85%的并行效率，在32个GPU上的强扩展性测试中实现了16倍加速。

Conclusion: GaDE求解器具有高度的可扩展性，使其非常适合在E级（Exascale）计算系统上运行，为探测相对论量子效应的超强激光实验提供了进行预测性模拟的能力。

Abstract: Modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems powered by advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures enable accelerating computing with unprecedented performance and scalability. Here, we present a GPU-accelerated solver for the three-dimensional (3D) time-dependent Dirac equation optimized for distributed HPC systems. The solver named GaDE is designed to simulate the electron dynamics in atoms induced by electromagnetic fields in the relativistic regime. It combines MPI with CUDA/HIP to target both NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures. We discuss our implementation strategies in which most of the computations are carried out on GPUs, taking advantage of the GPU-aware MPI feature to optimize communication performance. We evaluate GaDE on the pre-exascale supercomputer LUMI, powered by AMD MI250X GPUs and HPE's Slingshot interconnect. Single-GPU performance on NVIDIA A100, GH200, and AMD MI250X shows comparable performance between A100 and MI250X in compute and memory bandwidth, with GH200 delivering higher performance. Weak scaling on LUMI demonstrates exceptional scalability, achieving 85% parallel efficiency across 2048 GPUs, while strong scaling delivers a 16x speedup on 32 GPUs - 50% efficiency for a communication-intensive, time-dependent Dirac equation solver. These results demonstrate GaDE's high scalability, making it suitable for exascale systems and enabling predictive simulations for ultra-intense laser experiments probing relativistic quantum effects.

### [79] [Index-Tracking Portfolio Construction and Rebalancing under Bayesian Sparse Modelling and Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22109)
*Dimitrios Roxanas*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个基于贝叶斯统计的框架，用于构建和管理包含较少股票的指数追踪投资组合。该方法旨在量化不确定性，以在追踪市场指数的准确性、投资组合的规模以及交易成本之间取得平衡。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指数追踪策略需要持有大量股票并频繁交易，导致管理和交易成本高昂。本研究旨在创建一个实用的投资组合管理方法，既能紧密追踪一个大的市场指数（如标准普尔500指数），又能显著减少持有的股票数量和交易频率，同时还能对策略本身的不确定性进行量化分析。

Method: 作者将指数追踪问题构建为一个高维线性回归模型。他们对投资组合的权重采用稀疏性强的拉普拉斯先验分布，并通过一个全局“收缩参数”来平衡追踪误差和组合稀疏度。该参数通过经验贝叶斯方法进行校准。最后，研究使用近端朗之万蒙特卡洛（MCMC）算法来近似权重的后验分布，从而量化不确定性，并基于此提出具体的再平衡规则。

Result: 研究成功开发了一套完整的决策流程，不仅可以构建稀疏的追踪投资组合，还能提供关于追踪误差、组合构成和再平衡需求的后验不确定性量化。基于此，论文提出了具体的交易决策规则，用于平衡预期追踪误差与交易成本。最后，通过一个追踪标准普尔500指数的案例，展示了该工具在从头构建到后续调整的全过程中的实际应用效果。

Conclusion: 论文成功地从业内运筹学的视角，构建了一个用于稀疏指数追踪的综合框架。该框架强调不确定性的量化和策略的可实施性，为投资组合的构建与再平衡提供了实用的决策工具，帮助管理者在追踪效果与交易成本之间取得有效平衡。

Abstract: We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing.
