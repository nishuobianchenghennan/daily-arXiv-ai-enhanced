The model consists of two fermions with opposite charges under a hidden Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)_{D}$ and masses $m_{p_{D}}$ and $m_{e_{D}}$, respectively. Analogous to hydrogen in the Standard Model, these fermions interact via their own electromagnetic-like force, with a dark fine structure constant denoted by $α_{D}$, and can bind into neutral atomic (and molecular) dark states. Previous work has largely focused on the benchmark scenario where the dark sector mirrors ordinary matter, with $m_{e_{D}}$ near the electron mass, $m_{p_{D}}$ near the proton mass, and $α_{D}\\sim 1/137$. We extend this analysis by investigating dark recombination and cooling physics across the full parameter space of masses and couplings. Combining Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck and ACT with BAO and Pantheon+ data, we place new constraints on the atomic dark matter parameter space, identifying regions where acoustic damping and recombination dynamics leave observable imprints on the CMB."}

Beginning with a general parametrisation of top-FCNC couplings, we match these interactions onto the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operator basis at the top-quark scale. We then perform a global study that incorporates constraints from low-energy flavour observables, electroweak precision data, Higgs and gauge-boson measurements, and electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. By treating the dipole operators as complex, we derive stringent limits on both the real and imaginary components of left- and right-handed FCNC couplings. In particular, we show that constraints from the neutron EDM impose especially strong bounds on products of FCNC couplings involving the transition $t \\to u$. Translating these results into the SMEFT framework, we obtain robust constraints on several products of the corresponding SMEFT Wilson coefficients. Finally, we provide predictions for branching ratios and CP asymmetries in rare top-quark FCNC decays. We identify well-motivated benchmark scenarios for future collider searches and emphasise the crucial role of CP-violating effects in probing the flavour structure of the top quark."}

We derive constraints on the scalar self-interaction coupling $λ_s$, the mass $m_s$, and coefficients of quantum gravity-induced operators. We find that the constraints depend sensitively on the reheating dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that universal gravity effects do not necessarily spoil the predictivity of non-thermal dark matter scenarios with $k < 4$ and low reheating temperatures, as an extended reheating phase dilutes gravitationally-produced relics. For $k > 4$, on the other hand, the relic abundance is enhanced during the reheating phase, leading to stringent constraints on the scalar. In multi-stage reheating, we show that the enhancement/dilution effect of subsequent reheating phases factorises."}

Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations."}

In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$.

A defect line in the substrate on which the $α-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $α$. The latter tunes the $α-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($α=0$) to a dice lattice ($α=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $Δ(x) diag(1,\\quad -1,\\quad 1)$, assuming $Δ(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $α$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed.

We address the origin of the broad, $Γ$-point centered excitation continuum observed by inelastic neutron scattering at elevated temperatures in this compound. Using stochastic Landau-Lifshitz dynamics augmented with quantum-equivalent corrections, we reproduce the temperature-dependent dynamical spin structure factor across both the correlated and conventional paramagnetic regimes. A meta-analysis of 38 published exchange parameter sets identifies those most consistent with the full temperature evolution. A Bayesian optimization procedure is used to derive parameters that capture the low-energy star-like momentum dependence and the overall bandwidth of the continuum. Rescaling temperatures by the Curie--Weiss scale produces a collapse of spectral measures, demonstrating that the high-$T$ dynamics are governed by correlated paramagnetism below $θ_{\\mathrm{CW}}$ rather than by the Kitaev crossover to fractionalized excitations.

We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines.

Recently, the linear in temperature and linear in field resistivity have been simultaneously observed in high temperature cuprate superconductors, manifested by the universal field to temperature scaling in magnetoresistivity. To date, there has been a lack of coherent and unified understanding of these coexisting linear behaviors and their possible link to quantum criticality. In this work, we establish the universality in linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian behaviors in underdoped LSCO near optimal doping. Experimentally, we observe the linear in field Planckian scattering rate and its relation to its linear in temperature counterpart. Theoretically, we propose a spin based common microscopic mechanism based on Kondo-like charge fluctuations near local quantum criticality of heavy fermion formulated tJ model subject to a Zeeman term. Similar to frequency to temperature scaling near quantum criticality, we find the magnetic field here effectively introduces a Zeeman energy, reminiscent of an external energy in the quantum critical regime, leading to field to temperature scaling. Our analytically predicted universal field to temperature scaling in isotropic scattering rate and the relation between the linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian coefficients, unifies these two phenomena over an extended doping range, pointing toward a unified quantum-critical origin of Planckian transport in cuprates."}

Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features.

To address the present limitation on cathode material availability, more than 2000 previously synthesized oxides, chalcogenides, Prussian blue analogues, and polyanion materials were computationally screened for the discovery of highly stable RAZIB cathode materials. The structural, electrochemical, and chemical properties of the materials were respectively evaluated through an investigation of the available Zn$^{2+}$ percolation paths in the crystal structure, the stability of the material in aqueous media under RAZIB operation conditions, and the attained transition metal oxidation state during cycling. The transition metal oxidation state and intercalating ion coordination environment were determined to govern the magnitude of the calculated intercalation potential, with this finding directly supporting the development of batteries with high operation potentials. Finally, 10 previously unexplored materials were identified with leading metrics for operation as RAZIB cathode materials, such as high Zn$^{2+}$ (de)intercalation potential, electrochemical stability, theoretical gravimetric capacity, and energy density, being here proposed for experimental testing.

The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($Ω_\\mathrm{DM}\\simΩ_\\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs."}

Several theoretical proposals were considered for these systems. The Coulomb interaction between electrons allow a new approach to study this problem. In this paper, we use a usual Hubbard model with a local repulsive interaction to describe a 2D system. The system of equations are solved using the Green's functions method, within a Hubbard-I mean field approximation, which allows to treat the strong interaction limit. We consider both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions and obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Our results show, in the repulsive case, the existence of a superconducting ground state mediated by the kinetic electronic energy and described by a non-local order parameter. A minimum value of the repulsive interaction $U_{min}$ is required to create a pairing state. At finite temperatures, for strong interactions, the critical temperature $T_c$ shows a saturation similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation observed for strong attractive interactions."}

We suggest that even weak vertically correlated disorder (arising from interstitial-oxygen staging, twin boundaries, extended strain fields, or defect-pinned charge textures) can impose a layer-dependent modulation of the interlayer tunneling amplitude t(z). Because the bare interlayer coupling is intrinsically small, such modulations generate an effectively multichannel c-axis electrodynamic response, consistent with multi-component Josephson plasma resonances, nonmonotonic c-axis resistivity, redistribution of bilayer magnetic spectral weight, and field-enhanced vertical CDW correlations. We propose a phenomenological framework in which the organization of disorder, rather than its magnitude, governs the effective interlayer coupling and its electrodynamic signatures. This viewpoint unifies diverse c-axis anomalies across several cuprate families, suggesting that controlling vertical disorder correlations offers a viable pathway for tuning dimensionality and interlayer coherence in high-Tc superconductors."}

The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ νe^2$ that can exceed 10 k$Ω$ for the Landau-level filling factor $ν\\leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED."}

Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moiré domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moiré domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moiré domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moiré domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs)."}

Here, we propose a new GB stabilization mechanism, called self-pinning, in which the segregation atmosphere of a moving GB spontaneously breaks into solute-rich clusters, which produce a strong pinning effect in addition to the free energy reduction resulting from the segregation. The cluster formation is caused by strong solute-solute attraction at GBs, leading to a first-order transformation between solute-lean and solute-rich GB phases. The effect is demonstrated by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations capturing segregation thermodynamics, GB dynamics, and solute diffusion. The self-pinning provides an intrinsic stabilization mechanism for suppressing grain growth that couples thermodynamics and kinetics. The mechanism obviates the need for pre-existing second phase inclusions, refocusing the alloy design on GB phase behavior."}

Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window.

A meta-analysis of 38 published exchange parameter sets identifies those most consistent with the full temperature evolution. A Bayesian optimization procedure is used to derive parameters that capture the low-energy star-like momentum dependence and the overall bandwidth of the continuum. Rescaling temperatures by the Curie--Weiss scale produces a collapse of spectral measures, demonstrating that the high-$T$ dynamics are governed by correlated paramagnetism below $θ_{\\mathrm{CW}}$ rather than by the Kitaev crossover to fractionalized excitations.

In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework."}

We conclude with perspectives on how this rapidly evolving field could enable next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies leveraging the coupled dynamics of light, charge, and spin."}

Once the GPDs are constructed, we carry out a straightforward derivation of other desired physical observables such as the distribution functions and the electromagnetic form factors.

SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications."}

Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM \"kite\" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., \"teardrop\"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally."}

Inspired by twisted 2D materials, we utilize low-loss EELS to examine the plasmonic excitations in 2D moiré Au nanocrystal superlattices (NCSLs) formed by liquid-air interface self-assembly using a double-dipping method. This approach produces stacked hexagonal layers that can be twisted, forming moiré patterns in NCSLs whose twist angles are precisely measured via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Low-loss EELS effectively mitigates challenges arising from fabrication-induced non-uniformity and reveals a blue shift in plasmonic excitation when comparing single-layer, double-layer, and twisted configurations. This sharply contrasts with the optical spectroscopy measurements, which show an overall red shift relative to the EELS data. The high spatial resolution of STEM-EELS further demonstrates that twist-induced symmetry breaking strongly influences plasmonic behavior. Coupled dipole modeling explains the observed discrepancies: the electron beam excites out-of-plane polarization modes unavailable to optical probes, while optical measurements average over ensembles. Our findings highlight that EELS provides complementary information to optical spectroscopy for understanding how structural arrangements at the nanoscale influence collective electronic properties, advancing the design of plasmonic metamaterials."}

Recently, the linear in temperature and linear in field resistivity have been simultaneously observed in high temperature cuprate superconductors, manifested by the universal field to temperature scaling in magnetoresistivity. To date, there has been a lack of coherent and unified understanding of these coexisting linear behaviors and their possible link to quantum criticality. In this work, we establish the universality in linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian behaviors in underdoped LSCO near optimal doping. Experimentally, we observe the linear in field Planckian scattering rate and its relation to its linear in temperature counterpart. Theoretically, we propose a spin based common microscopic mechanism based on Kondo-like charge fluctuations near local quantum criticality of heavy fermion formulated tJ model subject to a Zeeman term. Similar to frequency to temperature scaling near quantum criticality, we find the magnetic field here effectively introduces a Zeeman energy, reminiscent of an external energy in the quantum critical regime, leading to field to temperature scaling. Our analytically predicted universal field to temperature scaling in isotropic scattering rate and the relation between the linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian coefficients, unifies these two phenomena over an extended doping range, pointing toward a unified quantum-critical origin of Planckian transport in cuprates."}

Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekulé distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekulé distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties."}

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity suggests half-metallic behaviour.

Our analyses reveal a quasiperiodicity-induced breakdown of the SFL regime, which evolves into either the NHSE or an extended regime, depending on boundary conditions. These results uncover the crucial role of quasiperiodicity in non-Hermitian systems."}

This nonlinear behavior occurs at low power levels, reduced by a strong spatial concentration of spin waves within the resonator.

We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories."}

However, the magnetic topological insulator state has typically been found in ferromagnets (FMs) that suffer from low magnetic ordering temperatures and stray fields. Identifying an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) with a relatively high Néel temperature has been a longstanding challenge. Here, we focus on the recently discovered van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet (AFM) UOTe, which not only features a high Néel temperature (\\(\\sim\\)150K) but also exhibits intriguing Kondo interaction and topological characteristics. Our systematic analysis of the layer-dependent topological phases based on \\textit{ab} initio computations predicts the two-layer UOTe film to be an ideal 2D AFM Chern insulator in which the Hall conductivity is quantized with a fully compensated spin magnetization. By applying an in-plane strain or electric field, we show how the itinerancy of U-5f electrons can be manipulated to trigger a transition between the nontrivial ($C = 1$) and trivial ($C = 0$) phases. Interestingly, the 3-layer UOTe film is found to have zero charge conductance but it hosts a quantized spin Hall conductivity (SHC) with finite magneto-electric coupling, suggesting the presence of an axion insulator-like state. The unique magnetic structure of UOTe supports a layer-tunable topology in which films with an odd number of layers are axion-like insulators, while films with an even number of layers are Chern insulators, and the bulk material is a Dirac semimetal.

Metal assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) in vapor is a plasma-free etching method that attracts considerable attention owing to the ability to create smooth, high aspect ratio nanostructures.

The locally constrained electrochemical interactions at the catalyst site make MacEtch particularly sensitive to catalyst contamination reducing the reaction rate and pinning the catalyst during etching. Removing contaminants is essential to improve pattern transfer for reliable processes on a larger area and higher aspect ratio.

Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics."}

Magnetism is introduced by including on-site spin splitting, spin-orbit coupling, and spin-canting angles. As a representative material, we study SrRuO$_3$, which supports spin canting and exhibits a sign change of the AHC. In the ferromagnetic phase, the low-energy AHC is found to be close to zero at the Fermi level, in agreement with experimental observations. We show that the dependence of the AHC on the relevant physical parameters is most pronounced in the central region of the electronic bandwidth. We determine the symmetry-allowed components of the AHC for different magnetic orders in the large family of transition-metal perovskite ABO$_3$ compounds with space group $62$, including the spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall effect. Within density functional theory, we evaluate the range of spin-canting angles in SrRuO$_3$ and demonstrate that it is suppressed as electronic correlations increase. By analyzing the AHC as a function of the canting angle, we find that the collinear magnetic configurations contribute most to the AHC, while spin canting plays a secondary role in determining its magnitude in non-collinear ferromagnets and altermagnets. However, canting can become relevant and induce a sign change of the AHC when the collinear magnetic state exhibits an AHC close to zero. Finally, we investigate the locations of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone and their evolution as a function of the canting angle."}

This nonlinear behavior occurs at low power levels, reduced by a strong spatial concentration of spin waves within the resonator. The resulting power-dependent transmission enables neuron-like activation behavior and frequency-selective nonlinear spin-wave absorption.

An important fundamental issue in the atomic and quantum-scale modeling of these materials is defining the macroscopic polarization. In a periodic crystal, the usual definition of the polarization as the first moment of the charge density in a unit cell is found to depend qualitatively - allowing even a change in the sign - and quantitatively on the choice of unit cell.\n  We examine this issue using a rigorous approach based on the framework of 2-scale convergence. By examining the continuum limit of when the lattice spacing is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the body, we show that the 2-scale limit provides both a bulk polarization as well as a surface charge density supported on the boundary of the body. Further, different choices of the periodic unit cell of the body lead to correspondingly different partial unit cells at the boundary; these choices give to different bulk polarization and surface charges but compensate such that the electric field and energy are independent of the choice of unit cell."}

Here, we report a membrane-enabled integration platform based on transferable single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 that overcomes these constraints at the system level. By exploiting the weak interplanar bonding of beta-Ga2O3 (100) plane, we obtain wafer-scale freestanding single-crystalline membranes that enable vertically integrated photodiodes with sub-microsecond, non-persistent photoresponse and high UV-visible rejection. Crucially, we introduce a stitching-based membrane assembly strategy that decouples array resolution from the size of the source single-crystalline substrate, allowing high-resolution photodetector arrays to be integrated onto silicon thin-film-transistor backplanes. The modular assembled active-matrix UV imaging arrays exhibit uniform solar-blind response without image lag, in stark contrast to arrays based on amorphous or polycrystalline films. Beyond beta-Ga2O3, this membrane-enabled and stitching-based modular integration strategy provides a general route toward high-speed, high-resolution electronic imaging systems using transferable single-crystalline semiconductors."}

However, there is still no general prescription on how long-range physical effects should be incorporated into the model while preserving well-established locality principles underlying most transferable ML representations. Here, we provide a physical perspective on the problem, by discussing how distinct contributions to the system's electrostatics can be captured through the adoption of different learning paradigms. Specifically, we discern between local charge models, which rely either on explicit charge-density decompositions or implicit auxiliary variables, and models where a notion of nonlocality is deliberately introduced, either via self-consistent procedures or by using nonlocal descriptors and learning architectures. We further address the related aspect of incorporating finite-field effects through the coupling with the system's polarization, relevant for the application of an external electric bias. We conclude by discussing the implications for the simulation of electrochemical interfaces, where long-range electrostatics are essential to capture the interplay between charge redistribution, interfacial dynamics, and ionic screening, and for ionic transport phenomena, which, although less explored, appear far less sensitive to their inclusion."}

Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale."}

Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moiré domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moiré domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moiré domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moiré domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs)."}
