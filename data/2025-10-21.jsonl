The\nfirst configuration consists of two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched between\nconventional s-wave superconductors, with the magnetization vectors of the\nferromagnets misaligned. The second involves three ferromagnetic layers\nembedded between two s-wave superconductors, with their magnetizations oriented\nalong the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In the first case, where the\nanomalous Josephson current is absent, odd-frequency spin-triplet correlations\ndevelop pronounced peaks at finite magnetization strengths in both the\ntunneling and transparent limits, while the equal-spin triplet component\nexhibits zeros at finite magnetizations in the transparent regime. In the\nsecond configuration, where an anomalous Josephson current is present, similar\npeaks in odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing appear at finite magnetizations\nunder both transport regimes, and the spatial profile of these correlations\nremains largely unaffected by the current\\rq{}s presence. The Josephson diode\nefficiency is finite and attains its maximum at magnetization values\ncorresponding to the peaks of the anomalous current. Overall, our results\ndemonstrate that the anomalous Josephson current has only a marginal effect on\nodd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, suggesting that the emergence of\nodd-frequency correlations and the Josephson diode effect are largely\nindependent phenomena, contrary to some earlier conjectures."}

Our first-principles calculations show that the AA stacking\nconfiguration induces antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer coupling, while a 180\nrotation of one layer (resulting in the antialigned AA stacking) leads to FM\ninterlayer coupling. Moreover, the interlayer magnetic coupling can be switched\nbetween AFM and FM by translating the stacking configuration: FM in the aligned\nAB and BA configurations, and AFM in the antialigned AB and BA configurations.\nThis switching behavior is driven by variations in superexchange interactions\ndue to orbital hopping between layers.

This work investigates hydrogenated aluminum-doped\nzinc oxide (AZO:H) deposited by spatial atomic layer deposition (s-ALD) as a\nviable indiumfree alternative for TOPCon-based bottom cells. The deposited\nAZO:H films demonstrate excellent transparency, exceeding 90% in the 380-1200\nnm wavelength range.

Predicting how the growth of defects affects material\nperformance is therefore a pressing problem in materials science. One common\ncomputational approach that is used to examine defect growth is cluster\ndynamics, a method which employs a system of mean-field rate equations to track\nthe time evolution of concentrations of individual defect types. However, the\ncomputational complexity of performing cluster dynamics can limit its practical\nimplementation, specifically in the context of exploring a broad set of\nphysical conditions corresponding to, for example, different temperatures and\npressures. Here, we present a machine learning approach to circumvent the\ncomputational challenges of performing cluster dynamics while maintaining high\naccuracy in the prediction of defect concentrations. The method is illustrated\non the nuclear material uranium nitride but is broadly applicable to other\nmaterials. The developed data-driven method is shown to accurately capture\ncomplex correlations between material properties, temperature, irradiation\nconditions, and the concentration of defects."}

Assuming the\nHiggs boson mediates the interaction between the Standard Model and the dark\nsector, dark quarks can be produced in e+e- collisions. The ensuing strong\ndynamics may lead to semi-visible jet final states, containing both visible and\ninvisible particles. We investigate semi-visible jets with different fractions\nof invisible states, and enriched in leptons and photons. When the invisible\ncomponent is large, selections based on kinematic features, such as the missing\nenergy in the event, already provide good signal-to-background discrimination.\nFor smaller invisible fractions, the reduced missing energy makes these signals\nmore similar to Standard Model events, and we therefore employ a graph neural\nnetwork jet tagger exploiting differences in jet substructure. This machine\nlearning strategy improves sensitivity and enhances the discovery prospects of\nHiggs boson-induced semi-visible jets at the Future Circular Collider. Our\nresults show that the proposed strategy can effectively probe a wide parameter\nspace for the models considered, and a variety of signatures, constraining the\nHiggs boson exotic branching ratios into dark quarks at the permille-level."}
