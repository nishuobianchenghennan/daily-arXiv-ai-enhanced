While prior studies have used monetary policy\ntexts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that\noverlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel\nframework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making\nprocess by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents.\nEach agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction\nbased on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic\nindicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by\nobserving the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus\nformation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable\nrepresenting each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we\ntheoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input\ninformation and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this\ndebate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines\nin prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides\ninsights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective\npolicy forecasts."}

At ambient conditions, Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ crystallizes in the cubic\nFm-3m structure, which remains stable below 8.0 GPa. Within this pressure\nrange, subtle inter-octahedral rotations develop, producing a gradual localized\ndeviation from the ideal cubic framework. This local reorientation facilitates\nradiative recombination, leading to a pronounced enhancement of PL intensity\nwith pressure up to 2.4 GPa. Beyond this pressure point, enhancement of\nnonradiative relaxation channels result in gradual PL quenching. Additionally,\nthe PL intensity increases upon the application of an external weak magnetic\nfield. A structural transition to the orthorhombic Pnnm phase occurs at around\n8.0 GPa, followed by a monoclinic P$2_1/m$ phase above 10.7 GPa, and eventual\namorphization beyond 25.5 GPa. Optical absorption spectra reveal continuous\nband-gap narrowing upon compression. These findings demonstrate the strong\ncoupling among lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and optical response in\nRb$_2$TeBr$_6$, underscoring its potential as a pressure-tunable optoelectronic\nmaterial"}

UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos\ndecouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d}\n\\approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann\nsuppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much\ngreater than $m_{\\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at\nfreeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for\nDM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying\nincompatibility with $\\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of\ninstantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and\naccount for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter\nspace. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo\nUFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative,\npost-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination.

Within this\nmodel, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine\ntheir positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for\ndispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl\npoints with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values\nof the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results\nshow that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum\nin the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex\nband-structure calculations."}

We start from an effective field theory viewpoint,\nconsidering the impact of renormalisation group effects on related observables\nand also examining assumptions on the broader UV flavour structure. We then\ngive an overview of the landscape of simplified models, investigating\nphenomenological constraints arising at higher orders. A short discussion of\nfine-tuning is also included."}

Our study finds that, independently of the value of\nthe coupling constant, requiring the photon self-energy to be finite for any\nmomenta, combined with a smooth behavior for the photon-fermion vertex, is\nequivalent to state that the photon is massless and that the photon propagator\ndiverges at low momenta as $1/k^2$. Furthermore, the Schwinger mechanism to\ngenerate, in a gauge invariant way, a photon mass is investigated and the form\nfactors that can be at the origin of a possible photon mass are identified. For\nthe Schwinger mechanism the link between the finiteness of the photon\nself-energy and the masslessness of the photon is lost. The infrared behavior\nof the fermion gap equation and the vertex equation are found to be infrared\nsafe integral equations. Moreover, by studying chiral fermions within QED it is\nobserved that the requirement of the finiteness of the photon self-energy\ntranslates into a fermion propagator that behaves as $\\slashed{p}/p^4$."}

Because of the effectiveness of the\nGlashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism in charm flavour-changing neutral currents,\nthose decays are driven by non-local insertions of four-quark operators.\nFollowing previous work, we consider the mediation of resonances both for the\ndipion and dilepton pairs. For the first time, we incorporate the effect of the\ncascade-type topology $D^0\\to \\pi^-\na_1^+(1260)(\\to\\pi^+\\rho^0(\\to\\ell^+\\ell^-))$, which manifests distinctly in\nthe invariant-mass and angular distributions. We find that this partial\namplitude comprises one of the largest contributions to the decay rate and\nobtain an unprecedented agreement of the Standard Model prediction with the\navailable LHCb data. Finally, we compare to the available CLEO-c, LHCb, and\nBESIII amplitude analyses for the analogous four-body hadronic decays and find\nthat similar values of the hadronic parameters of our model successfully\ndescribe the two classes of decays."}
