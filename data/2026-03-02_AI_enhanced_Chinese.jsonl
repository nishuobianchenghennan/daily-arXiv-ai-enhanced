In the presence of sufficiently strong particle self-interactions (characterized by the decay constant $f$), scalars are ejected from BH orbits, resulting in coherent, non-relativistic emissions that continuously carry away the BH's angular momentum. Parameters exist for which cloud growth is much faster, and scalar depletion is much slower, than the age of the Galaxy. This defines a distinct class of astrophysical sources of scalars, which we call \\emph{BH scalar sirens} -- BHs that persistently emit scalars effectively forever. We compute the scalar background from the expected population of $N_\\text{BH}\\sim 10^{8}$ isolated stellar-mass BHs in the Milky Way, which are sirens for scalars in the mass range $10^{-13}$--$10^{-11}\\,$eV and $f\\lesssim 10^{14}$--$10^{9}\\,$GeV. This provides a detection target independent of early-universe scalar production or cosmological initial conditions. The generated observable signals are up to two orders-of-magnitude larger than those expected from a misaligned cosmic scalar in this mass range. The energy spectrum of emitted scalars is distinctly broader and at higher velocities (up to $\\sim 10^{-1}c$) than that of virialized dark matter, and encodes the mass and spin distributions of the BH population. While stellar-mass Milky Way BHs are our primary target, our framework extends to supermassive, intermediate-mass and light BHs. Given the difficulty of directly observing populations of isolated BHs, scalar emissions offer a novel probe of these otherwise invisible objects, highlighting the potential for joint discovery between scalars and BHs, and broadly motivating searches for scalars over many orders-of-magnitude in mass.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In order to capture the collective effects of such an axion ensemble, we model the string axiverse by $N$ coupled axions with a simple assumption: hierarchical axion masses that arise from hierarchical instantons with statistically distributed axion couplings. In this limit, we find that axion field ranges, which determine late-time cosmological abundances, shrink as $1/\\sqrt{N}$ as the number of axions grows. Moreover, the heaviest modes tend to align with the smallest kinetic eigenvalues, further reducing their field ranges. Interactions with the Standard Model (SM) are largely set by the kinetic structure and do not grow with $N$, thus suppressing detection prospects relative to the individual-axion expectation. The exceptions are the ensemble's lightest and heaviest states as well as the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) axion, which incur no such suppression. We further find that coupled axiverse dark matter has parametrically relaxed tuning on initial conditions when produced via long, low-scale inflation relative to independent axions and high-scale inflation. Taken together, these results sharpen the observational outlook: the most accessible signals typically come from the QCD axion and from heavy axions that make up small dark matter subcomponents. An anthropic plateau of comparable energy density states produces subdominant signals; meanwhile, if light axions have SM interactions independent of QCD, they can also be within reach of future direct-detection experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce an SOG splitting of the pressure-related $1/r^3$ kernel, yielding a smooth short-/long-range decomposition for instantaneous pressure evaluation. The long-range part is treated in Fourier space by random-batch importance sampling. Because the radial and non-radial pressure components favor different proposals, direct sampling either increases structure-factor evaluations and communication or leads to substantial variance inflation. To address this tradeoff, we introduce a measure-recalibration strategy that reuses Fourier modes drawn from the radial proposal and corrects them for the non-radial target, producing an unbiased pressure estimator with significantly reduced variance and negligible extra cost. The resulting method mitigates pressure artifacts caused by cutoff discontinuities in traditional Ewald-based treatments while preserving near-optimal $O(N)$ complexity. We provide theoretical evidence on pressure decomposition error, consistency of stochastic approximation, and convergence of RBSOG-based MD. Numerical experiments on bulk water, LiTFSI ionic liquids, and DPPC membranes show that RBSOG accurately reproduces key structural and dynamical observables with small batch sizes ($P\\sim 100$).

Recently, a new class of spontaneous altermagnets has been theoretically predicted in a correlated two orbital model, driven by the coexistence of antiferromagnetic spin and staggered orbital ordering, thus broadening the scope of altermagnetic phenomena to systems with strong correlations. It has been noted, however, that the required spin and orbital order violates the well-established Goodenough-Kanamori (GK) rules, which underlie much of our understanding of magnetism in complex systems. Here we show that materials with three active orbitals may offer a more realistic route to this exotic state. Specifically, we consider a two-dimensional system with $t_{2g}^{2}$ electrons and identify a novel microscopic mechanism that allows the formation of a spontaneous altermagnetic Mott insulator. We explain how the GK rules are circumvented and provide the stability criteria by employing unbiased mean-field and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In addition, for the first time, we uncover the presence and microscopic origin of chirally split magnons in these spontaneous altermagnets, with experimentally measurable spin conductivities. Finally, we predict that the application of a small in-plane magnetic field induces, in the presence of weak atomic spin-orbit coupling, an as-yet unreported hybrid chiral magnon-orbiton mode with a non-zero orbital polarization giving rise to finite longitudinal and transverse orbital conductivities under a thermal gradient.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study proposes and validates a multi-element doping strategy as a superior approach to tailor the properties of SFO. The specific oxide Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.125Sn0.125Sc0.125Zr0.125O6 (SFO-ZSSM) is designed, synthesized via a solid-state reaction method, and systematically evaluated as a cathode for proton-conducting SOFCs (H-SOFCs).

Structural characterization confirms the successful formation of a phase-pure perovskite structure with homogeneous elemental distribution. Electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements reveal that SFO-ZSSM exhibits dramatically enhanced oxygen and proton transport kinetics compared to all singly-doped counterparts, demonstrating a significant synergistic effect.

The consequences for the magnetic quantum phase transition vary between different classes of magnets. In almost all 3-d systems with a homogeneous magnetization, as well as in magnetic nematics and in altermagnets, the long-ranged correlations generically modify the nature of the magnetic quantum phase transition from second order to first order.

In helimagnets, spin-wave systems, and N{\u00e9}el antiferromagnets their effect is even weaker and does not change the order of the transition if the ordering wave number is sufficiently large. In systems with quenched disorder the transition generically is of second order, but the correlations modify the critical behavior.

The field-induced transition from a low-field even-parity state to a high-field odd-parity state is usually described as a singlet-triplet transition. However, it is uncommon for a single compound to exhibit both triplet and singlet SC scenarios. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibilities of symmetry changes in the SC state without a change of spin multiplicity. To this end, we construct the SC order parameter based on Anderson pair functions, considering the phase winding within the symmetry of the point group $D_{4h}$ and the magnetic group $4/mm^{\\prime }m^{\\prime}$. It was found that two triplets with opposite-spin and equal-spin pairing states of symmetry $E_{1u}^{\\prime +}$, are nodeless but exhibit distinct internal structures and may be associated with low-and high-field phases. Additionally, nontrivial Cooper pairing resulting from the non-symmorphic structure of the space group was examined, particularly in the case where the Fermi surface intersects with the boundaries of a Brillouin zone (BZ). It was determined that at the X point, triplet pairs are even, while singlet pairs can be either even or odd. Furthermore, at the X point, pair density waves that alter phase by $\u03c0$ at the atomic centers linked by lattice translations are also feasible.

In these regimes, current universal machine-learning interatomic potentials often fail, largely due to systematic gaps in traditional training datasets that heavily emphasize low-energy, near-equilibrium structures.

Training a Graph Atomic Cluster Expansion (GRACE) model on the resulting statistically maximized entropy (SMAX) dataset yields markedly improved robustness across a range of stringent benchmarks.

First, the weak upturn in the low-temperature tail of our data has been confirmed to originate from the background, and the paramagnetic Meissner effect is absent in our case; thus, field-cooled (FC) data can be used for superconducting phase fraction calculations. Second, demagnetization effect must be calculated based on the actual measured moment as a function of $f$, which has been well-established and routinely employed in the superconductivity community. In contrast, Korolev and Talantsev treated the demagnetization field as a constant; thus, their calculation underestimates $f$ by a factor of $(1-N\u03c7_{meas})(1-N)$. This factor is close to 1/3, given $N$ = 0.849, $\u03c7_{meas}$ = -1.313 in our study, which explains the origin of their deviated result (nearly three times smaller than our results). Third, our sample is a homogeneous high-quality bulk single crystal, evidenced by various techniques, making the existence of multiple discrete superconducting regions highly unlikely.

The temporal sequence for the analysis includes the instant after electron injection, followed by the time required for a small change in electron wavenumber away from initial injection, leading to the final time evolution over many Bloch periods. The time-dependent behavior is studied using the properties of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The electric field is described through the vector potential gauge, and the instantaneous eigenstates of the Bloch, electric-field-dependent Hamiltonian are used as basis states in describing the Bloch dynamics in the electric field. For each temporal sequence considered, the solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is established and comparatively discussed. The expectation value of the momentum is obtained for the special case of first order in a constant electric field; the resulting velocity derived is a field-dependent generalization of the natural Zitterbewegung-like behavior discussed in the recent literature. The early-time and long-time limits of the momentum expectation value and its time derivative demonstrate that the resistance to Bloch acceleration after initial band injection varies from real mass to effective mass dynamics as the electron accelerates through the band under the influence of electric field.

In recent work, this possibility has been explored for the case when these SM fields are fermionic. In this paper, we extend this idea to the case of the SM $W$ boson employing a previously examined model wherein PM consists of a complex scalar triplet plus a complex singlet, both of which obtain vevs and thus also generate the DP mass. While this setup results in a somewhat stronger interaction between the DP and the $W$ than in the familiar KM setup, the rate for $W+$DP production at the LHC is shown to still be rather small and is very difficult to observe due to large SM backgrounds. The direct production of the scalar PM itself, however, is shown to lead to similar new physics signatures but with much larger rates and are considered here in their own right.

Structural analysis shows that the bromine-poor phase WTe2Br0.5 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pmmn, thereby maintaining a uniform stacking sequence. In contrast, the bromine-rich WTe2Br1.25 phase (space group Imm2) adopts an architecture where two distinct types of bromine layers alternate between the host layers. For the iodine system, the compound WTe2I exhibits both incommensurate and commensurate (3+1)D modulated variants in the superspace group P21/m(\u03b10\u03b3)00. In the commensurate polytype, the structural modulation locks into a rational vector, q = (1/2, 0, 1/6), which can be described also as a 3D supercell. Electronic structure calculations show WTe2Br0.5 and commensurately modulated WTe2I to be metals with flat bands at the Fermi energy arising from the intercalation. These findings demonstrate the unusual stability and structural flexibility of anionic intercalation in a transition metal dichalcogenides.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Building on the anharmonic lattice dynamics (ALD) framework, kALDo2.0 provides efficient CPU and GPU-accelerated implementations of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for crystals and the quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo (QHGK) method. QHGK extends thermal transport predictions beyond crystals to disordered materials, including glasses, alloys, and complex nanostructures. kALDo2.0 introduces native integration with modern machine-learned potentials (MLPs), enabling thermal transport workflows that combine the accuracy of first-principles methods with the scalability of classical force fields. It also features comprehensive support for temperature-dependent effective potentials workflows, flexible storage backends for large-scale calculations, and advanced quantification of anharmonicity. The software seamlessly interfaces with electronic structure codes (Quantum ESPRESSO, VASP), molecular dynamics packages (LAMMPS), and MLPs (ACE, NEP, MACE, MatterSim, Orb), enabling thermal transport studies from 0 K to finite temperatures. kALDo2.0 implements multiple BTE solution strategies and essential physical corrections, including isotopic scattering and non-analytical terms for polar materials. A modular Python architecture with lazy evaluation and multiple storage formats (ASCII, NumPy, HDF5) enables simulations of systems containing up to tens of thousands of atoms.

We investigate the spin dynamics of K$_2$Ni(SeO$_3$)$_2$, a nearly ideal spin-1 triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, using inelastic neutron scattering. Below the ordering temperature $T_{\\rm N}$, we observe coherent one-magnon excitations coexisting with a broad high-energy continuum. Two complementary approaches, a spectrally consistent $1/S$-corrected spin wave theory and a beyond-mean-field Schwinger boson theory, reproduce different facets of the continuum. Neither alone is complete, demonstrating substantial quantum fluctuations survive for $S\\!=\\!1$ and are reflected primarily in the spectral distribution of the continuum. Above $T_{\\rm N}$, the continuum bandwidth is conserved while spectral weight is redistributed as magnons lose spatial coherence. Our results establish K$_2$Ni(SeO$_3$)$_2$ as a model triangular antiferromagnet, identifying bandwidth conservation and the distribution of spectral weight within the continuum as organizing principles to understand the spin dynamics of ordered quantum magnets beyond spin-1/2.

Recent advances have demonstrated that contact performance can be dramatically improved through interface engineering, including the use of group-V semimetals and charge-transfer contacts based on strong interfacial doping. Here, we show that controlled interfacial oxidation provides an effective route to convert a semimetal contact into a charge-transfer contact that degenerately $n$-dopes single layer MoS$_2$. Using a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron diffraction, low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that putting single layer MoS$_2$ in contact with a pristine Bi layer merely results in weak doping, whereas oxidation of the Bi layer leads to a pronounced occupation of the MoS$_2$ conduction band with an electron density on the order of $10^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. The cause of this strong electron doping is the fact that an ultrathin $\u03b2$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ layer forms below the MoS$_2$ and that this has a particularly low work function, thereby acting as an efficient electron donor to MoS$_2$. Interfacial oxidation thus emerges as a powerful design knob for engineering charge-transfer contacts to 2D semiconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Argyrodites are a class of superionic materials used in their bulk form for applications in solid-state batteries and thermoelectrics, where their advantageous properties relate to their polymorphism. However, despite their well-studied bulk applications, the limited exploration at the nanoscale has left considerable potential for the discovery of emerging properties due to size effects. Further, phase identification presents a prominent challenge to the study of polymorphs in superionic conductors and related mate-rials. In this work, we synthesize canfieldite-like (Ag8SnS6) nanocrystals to understand their formation and structural behavior at the nanoscale. We observe the emergence of emissive, meta-stable, cluster-like species. Then, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals indistinguishable polymorphs of canfieldite due to identical heavy-atom frameworks. However, using synchrotron X-ray total scattering for pair distribution function analysis, we uncover structural distortions, showing a pseudo-orthorhombic configuration that likely gives rise to the red emission. Further, we investigate the optical properties and structure of Ag8SnS6 nanocrystals upon the addition of Zn2+, the cation of interest in the canfieldite vs. pirquitasite (Ag2ZnSnS4) phase identification controversy. We show that Zn2+ is incorporated in the canfieldite-like structure through the replacement of Ag+, boosting the emission.
