Comments are welcome, in\n  particular on missing essential references", "summary": "The Meissner effect, the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a\nmetal entering the superconducting state, is arguably the most fundamental\nproperty of superconductors, discovered in 1933. The conventional theory of\nsuperconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the\nMeissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus,\nrooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there\nare questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field\nexpulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a\nreductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be\nresolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory,\nnamely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition\nprocess. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where\nmotion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We\nreview how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer\nbetween electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge\nmotion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications\nregarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to\nsearch for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures.\nTherefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important."}

This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a\nchannel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential\non the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the\nvelocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either\ndirection for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect.\nWhen the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the\nskyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the\nvelocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value,\nresulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a\nnonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied\nfields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode\neffect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes\nskyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the\nchannel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the\nskyrmion to interact with the \"hard\" asymmetry side of the channel, while a\nnegative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry\nside.

Their dual functionality as\nboth spin sources and information carriers could enable all-electrical\nself-induced switching of antiferromagnetic order, offering great potential for\nultra-compact spintronic devices. However, related progress is still elusive.\nHere, we report the deterministic switching of chiral antiferromagnetic orders\ninduced by charge current at zero external magnetic field in the van der Waals\n(vdW) magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoTa3S6. This\nsystem exhibits strong interactions between cobalt atom magnetic moment lattice\nand itinerant electrons within the metallic layers, as demonstrated by\ntemperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy, and topological Nernst effect measurements. Notably, the\nitinerant-localization interactions lead to current-induced chiral spin orbit\ntorques as well as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange torques that\ninteract with the localized magnetic moments, facilitating all-electrical\nswitching of the chiral magnetic order in the CoTa3S6 flake. Our work opens a\npromising avenue for manipulating antiferromagnetic orders by delicately\nengineering the synergistic interactions between magnetic moments and itinerant\nelectrons."}

The TM cavity mode is strongly hybridized with an\nintersubband transition of the 2DEG, forming a polaritonic mode in the\nultrastrong coupling regime, while the TE mode remains an almost purely cavity\nmode. The magnetoplasmon excitation emerging from the presence of the magnetic\nfield couples with both TM and TE modes, exhibiting different coupling\nstrengths and levels of spatial field inhomogeneity. While the strong\nhomogeneity of the bare TE mode gives rise to the standard anticrossing of\nstrong coupling, the inhomogeneous polaritonic TM mode is shown to activate an\nobservable Coulombic effect in the spectral response, often referred to as\nnon-locality. This experiment demonstrates a cavity-induced modification of the\n2DEG response and offers a new route to probing the effect of Coulomb\ninteractions in ultrastrongly coupled systems via reshaping of their cavity\nmode profiles."}
