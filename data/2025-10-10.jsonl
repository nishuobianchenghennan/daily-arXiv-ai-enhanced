Many different cosmological\nscenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in\nqualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this\nvariety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from\nuniversal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire\nperturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power\nspectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the\nuniverse? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of\ncosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that\nthe most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales\nis entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different\ninitial field values $\\theta_{\\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in\nthe field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature\nperturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to\nthe initial condition, $\\partial \\Omega_a / \\partial \\theta_{\\rm ini}$, which\ncan be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component\nthat contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain\nthat an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with\nnontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on\nadiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various\nassumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential.\nOur aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of\nthose assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario."}

Using many-body quantum transport theory,\nwe show that increasing the number of repeat units leaves the fundamental gap\nessentially unchanged while giving rise to a split-node spectrum whose\ncumulative broadening dramatically enhances the thermopower. This form of\nquantum enhancement can exceed other interference-based mechanisms, such as the\ncoalescence of nodes into a supernode, suggesting new opportunities for\nscalable quantum-interference-based materials. Although illustrated here with\ncross-conjugated systems, the underlying principles apply broadly to\nseries-connected architectures hosting multiple interference nodes. Finally, we\nevaluate the scaling of the electronic figure of merit ZT and the maximum\nthermodynamic efficiency. Together, these results highlight the potential for\nsplit-node-based materials to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response."}

Within a\ntight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral\nproperties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When\nthe junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet\npairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the\ncoexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin\ntriplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets\nreveal a divergent $1/\\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled,\nwhich is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The\nzero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear\nlow-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in\nthe texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological\nsegments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic\nbarrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they\nhybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the\nouter edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the\nsuperconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological\nregime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight\nthe central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of\ntopological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions."}

Thin films\nof RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser\ndeposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates,\nrespectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with\ndepth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic\nfields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K.

The localized magnetic response is consistent across different\nsubstrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin\nrelated to surface defects and dimensionality effects.
