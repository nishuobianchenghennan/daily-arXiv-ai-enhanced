Submitted for publication", "summary": "The findings on the spin polarization of $Λ$, $Ξ$, and $Ω$ hyperons and spin alignment of $K^{*0}$, $φ$, and $D^{*+}$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at the RHIC and LHC facilities propose the emergence of a strong vorticity field produced in these collisions. Contemplating the potential impact of vorticity on the space-time evolution of deconfined QCD matter and its freeze-out properties, we aim to investigate its characteristics within the medium. We introduce a complementary and data-driven approach to quantify the global vorticity field by extracting it directly from the transverse momentum spectra of produced hadrons. Employing the experimental data for $Λ$, $Ξ$, $Ω$, $K^{*0}$, $K^{*\\pm}$, $φ$, $ρ$, and $D^{*+}$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions over a wide range of beam energies, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=7.7$ GeV-5.02 TeV, and centrality classes, we systematically examine spin-vorticity coupling in the medium. Our finding on the magnitude of the extracted vorticity is consistent with values deduced from $Λ$ and $\\barΛ$ polarization measurements using statistical thermal models under the non-relativistic limit. Notably, we observe a prominent particle-species dependence of the vorticity, as well as a non-trivial variation with collision centrality and beam energy. These results indicate that vorticity-driven spin phenomena are sensitive to hadron structure and freeze-out dynamics, providing new constraints on the rotational properties of the QCD matter."}

While conventional magnetization measurements can detect superparamagnetic signatures, they often require the application of high perturbative fields and are difficult to implement for magnetic layers integrated within functional devices. In this study, we non-invasively investigate the superparamagnetic spin dynamics of a nanoscale CoFeB layer of thickness 1.1 nm, deposited on a diamond substrate, by probing its low-frequency near-field electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers-based quantum dephasometry. Our measurements reveal an unconventional, non-monotonic temperature dependence of the dephasing time of NV centers, which we attribute to EM fluctuations produced by thermally driven superparamagnetic domain flipping in CoFeB. Our findings are further supported by the theoretical interpretation of the dephasing dynamics of NV centers and the complementary SQUID-based magnetization characterizations of the CoFeB layer. Additionally, exploiting the technique of NV dephasometry, we extract the spectral density of the EM fluctuations in CoFeB, which is used to isolate different components of the EM fluctuations acting on NV centers. We also measure the CoFeB-to-NV distance-dependent coherence times of NV centers to investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the CoFeB layer on the generated near-field EM fluctuations. These results provide critical insight into the magnetization dynamics and near-field EM environment of nanoscale magnetic layers. It also has significant implications for the development of hybrid quantum spintronic devices and applications involving nanoscale opto-magnetic materials."}

In this framework we study phenomenological consequences for neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon number asymmetry. Since the required dark matter abundance cannot be explained by a neutral component of the inert doublet scalar, the lightest right-handed neutrino should be dark matter.

Flynn", "Lorenza Viola", "Benedetta Flebus"], "title": "Dynamical metastability and transient topological magnons in interacting driven-dissipative magnetic systems", "comment": "29 pages, 19 figures", "summary": "Metastability, i.e., partial relaxation to long-lived, quasi-stationary states before true asymptotic equilibrium sets in, emerges ubiquitously in classical and quantum dynamical systems as a result of timescales separation. In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond."}

In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a Néel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to Néel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the Néel order vanishes for $J_1 > 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases."}

Here we step out from the superconducting state and discuss the effect of the shunt resistor on the resistive state of a superconducting wire, at elevated currents still below the critical current for the transition to the normal state. We reveal how the shunt resistance controls the system dynamics and the onset of different resistive phases that include hot-spot and phase-slippage events. The accompanying dynamic current redistribution in the circuit also affects the local heating properties and additionally contributes to the control of the resistive state, particularly important at the elevated operation temperatures."}

This transition is manifested in lattice parameters, transport, thermodynamics, and magnetic susceptibility, yet remains remarkably insensitive to magnetic fields up to at least 14 T, indicating an electronically driven reconstruction. At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts. The wide separation between the electronic reconstruction at TA and the emergence of nonlinear dynamics at T* identifies Ba4Ru3O10 as a rare correlated system hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic state intertwined with antiferromagnetism."}

We compare standard Monte Carlo (MC) vs QMC results using Sobol' low discrepancy sequences, different sampling strategies, and various analyses of performance. We find that QMC outperforms MC in most cases, including the highest-dimensional simulations, showing faster and more stable convergence. Regarding greeks computation, we compare standard approaches, based on finite differences (FD) approximations, with adjoint methods (AAD) providing evidences that, when the number of greeks is small, the FD approach combined with QMC can lead to the same accuracy as AAD, thanks to increased convergence rate and stability, thus saving a lot of implementation effort while keeping low computational cost. Using GSA, we are able to fully explain our findings in terms of reduced effective dimension of QMC simulation, allowed in most cases, but not always, by Brownian Bridge discretization or PCA construction. We conclude that, beyond pricing, QMC is a very effcient technique also for computing risk measures, greeks in particular, as it allows to reduce the computational effort of high dimensional Monte Carlo simulations typical of modern risk management."}

This interaction not only induces a high hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi level, but also softens the hydrogen phonon modes, thereby significantly enhancing the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, embedding the strongly ionic Li3H lattice into the covalent Cu-H framework stabilizes the structure at significantly low pressures via a chemical-template effect, while maintaining high-Tc. Li3CuH4 exhibits excellent thermodynamic stability at 20 GPa, with a Tc of 39.25 K at 12 GPa. Further comprehensive high-throughput studies on Li3MH4 (M = transition metal) compounds uncover general principles applicable to a broader range of compounds.

Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(π,π)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(π,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist.

This representation enables financial structures to be analysed as computable economic systems whose performance and risk characteristics can be evaluated consistently across alternative configurations within a unified stochastic environment.

We benchmark this framework by calculating the equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli of C, BN, BP, and Si. Our analysis demonstrates that AFQMC systematically corrects the lack of long-range screening in MP2 and the missing higher-order exchange in RPA. We identify RPA as the optimal reference method due to the rapid convergence of the remaining short-range correlations with respect to supercell size. The resulting lattice constants exhibit a mean absolute relative error of 0.14 % relative to experiment, establishing the method as a rigorous benchmark tool for structural properties in condensed matter systems."}

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems."}

Phase-pure beta-TaON is retained up to 10 at.% V, beyond which secondary phases (Ta2O5 and VN) form, indicating a threshold of ~10 at.% under the applied synthesis conditions. All samples exhibit a porous microstructure. Increasing vanadium content induces a redshift in the absorption edge, reducing the bandgap from 2.72 eV (undoped) to 2.38 eV at 25 at.% V for the main beta-TaON phase, in agreement with DFT results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms substitutional incorporation of V5+ for Ta5+ in the beta-TaON lattice. DFT calculations reveal reduced electron effective mass, enhanced n-type conductivity, and favorable band edge shifts enabling spontaneous overall water splitting at <=10 at.% V. Photoelectrochemical measurements show improved photocurrent and more negative onset potentials for 5-10 at.% V, while higher V doping degrades performance due to phase segregation, which likely increases recombination and hinders interfacial charge transport.

This allows us to reliably generate ultrasharp spin wave dynamics with broad frequency tunability from the pump and magnetic field. We show that the spontaneous mode can be phase-locked to a probe tone, similar to an auto-oscillator. Furthermore, the spontaneous dynamics can be used to implement a high-gain magnonic parametric amplifier with a gain up to 40 dB.

In this work, we investigate the fabrication of Nd$2$Ni${0.8}$Cu${0.2}$O${4+δ}$ thin films using a room temperature RF sputtering process followed by moderate temperature annealing.

We examine the effect of sputtering power density on phase formation and film stoichiometry through X-ray diffraction, Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and temperature dependent resistivity measurements. Increasing the sputtering power density strongly reduces the presence of spurious phases and promotes stabilization of the desired n=1 Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Films deposited at 230 W (3.1 W cm$^{-2}$) exhibit a predominant NNCO structure, elemental ratios close to nominal composition, and resistivity values consistent with bulk materials.

Cotton-derived hydrogels were synthesized via an alkaline dissolution-gelation route and modified with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) to enhance ionic conductivity. The ionic modification increased the hydrogel conductivity from 17.1 to 37.8 mS cm^-1, confirming a nearly twofold improvement in ion transport efficiency. The resulting hydrogel exhibited improved thermal stability, homogeneous ionic transport, and strong polymer-ion interactions confirmed by FTIR and TGA analyses. In a symmetric device, the ion-modified hydrogel enables reduced equivalent series resistance, faster charge-transfer kinetics, and a short time constant (tau = 3.2 s), comparable to commercial energy-storage systems. After 1000 cycles, the device exhibits a 12.3% increase in specific capacitance, confirming stable proof-of-concept operation. Cycling leads to a moderate increase in R_ESR (18 to 22 ohm) and tau (3.2 to 4.1 s), indicating slower charge-ion redistribution. Notably, this R_ESR includes the contribution of the test-cell setup; in compact coin-type configurations, the resistance would be considerably lower. EIS reveals a concurrent rise in interfacial resistive terms, consistent with post-cycling hydrogel darkening and FTIR evidence of Fe-SCN coordination, suggesting that resistance buildup mainly originates from minor Fe-SCN interactions when the expelled liquid reaches the stainless-steel collector, rather than from loss of capacitive functionality. Overall, these results demonstrate the viability of cotton waste-derived hydrogels and chitosan-based electrodes as sustainable components for green energy storage, offering a recyclable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional systems."}

Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$.

While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. This study provides insights into the emergent magnetic phases and transition temperatures relevant to oxide heterostructures."}

Here, we investigate Josephson effects in planar and vertical junctions based on CsV$_2$Te$_2$O-family materials, which host hidden $d$-wave altermagnetism with G-type antiferromagnetic order. In monolayer-based planar junctions, the quasi-1D, nearly flat, spin-polarized bands of the altermagnet, when coupled to $s$-wave superconductors, produce a \\textit{fully} spin-polarized supercurrent with strong directional anisotropy -- a spin-selective Josephson effect. In multilayers, we uncover an \\textit{altermagnetic even-odd effect}: spin-polarized supercurrents persist only in odd-layer planar junctions but cancel exactly in even layers. Thus, layer parity acts as a switch for spin-polarized supercurrent. In vertical junctions, odd-layer barriers enhance equal-spin triplet transport while even layers favor opposite-spin transport, yielding a robust period-two oscillation in the total supercurrent with layer number. These layer-parity-dependent responses represent a general even-odd effect in hidden altermagnets, applicable to diverse magnetic and transport phenomena."}

These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory."}

Here, a multiscale atomistic simulation framework is employed to investigate SHI-induced track formation and recovery in monoclinic beta-Ga2O3 over a wide range of electronic energy losses (Se) and crystallographic orientations. A sequence of distinct structural responses is identified with increasing Se: complete lattice recovery at low Se, recrystallization into a metastable gamma-Ga2O3 phase at intermediate Se, and the formation of core-shell ion tracks at high Se, consisting of an amorphous core surrounded by a recrystallized gamma-phase shell. Despite the essentially isotropic initial energy deposition, the final ion-track morphology exhibits pronounced crystallographic anisotropy, governed by orientation-dependent recovery dynamics. The superior recrystallization along [010] direction is attributed to its exceptionally high elastic stiffness. Notably, SHI irradiation perpendicular to the (100) plane induces a more severe structural response at low Se (less than 10 keV/nm), however, at higher Se, it yields a smaller residual ion track compared with the other orientations. The simulated ion-track sizes show excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental measurements over a broad range of Se values. These findings establish a unified atomic-scale picture of core-shell track formation and anisotropic recovery in beta-Ga2O3."}

A key advantage of the pHEFT construction is its parameter choice, which maintains linear relations between the UV Lagrangian parameters and squared heavy masses. By strictly employing the inverse squared heavy masses as the expansion parameters without imposing additional constraints, pHEFT preserves maximal ultraviolet (UV) information and ensures higher perturbative accuracy by avoiding the additional truncations inherent in more complex, non-linear formulations or extra constraints.

The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms."}

In this study, we report an ultrahigh thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of approximately 800 MW/m2-K at the atomically-sharp AlN-SiC interface, achieved through an ion implantation-enhanced nucleation epitaxy technique. This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices."}

Using this framework, we design MEMM-based memory and logic blocks, including a 1T1R array, two inverter implementations (complementary two-device and single-device), and a three-input majority gate, and evaluate deep-pipelined operation. The model projects switching energies down to 1 aJ per operation and logic propagation delays of 30-60 ps, indicating MEMM as a promising platform for energy-constrained, high throughput computing."}

The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times."}

In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory."}

The analytical solutions of the momenta with zero eigenvalue for an AA stacking allows us to generalize the results of the zero energy momenta for arbitrarily stacked MLGs.

Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference. Finally we demonstrate that chiral impurities that break time-reversal symmetry induce characteristic spatial THz-STM signatures that can be used as a direct probe of Floquet edge state chirality."}

Using density functional theory calculations, we aim to show relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets, focusing on a broad class of ferromagnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry, and compare with fcc Ni. In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets. Because ferromagnets typically have larger bandwidths than altermagnets, they provide a promising platform for observing even-wave relativistic spin-momentum locking and associated emergent phenomena. From an application standpoint, relativistic spin-momentum locking governs symmetry-allowed spin Hall currents, spin photocurrents, and other momentum-dependent spin responses in k-space."}

Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals."}

Two widely used methods for determining these efficiencies are based on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), spin pumping FMR for the inverse effect, and spin-torque FMR for the direct effect. A key parameter to achieve accurate quantification, especially for spin-pumping FMR, is the RF field strength, $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. We present a comprehensive theoretical model and experimental protocol that allow a correct quantification of $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. It was validated by extensive experimental results and it was rigorously tested across various antennas geometries and ferromagnetic systems. We demonstrate that odd-symmetric Lorentzian voltages-which perfectly mimic spin-pumping or spin-torque FMR signals-can arise purely from rectification effects (due to anisotropic magnetoresistance) when $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$ orientation is parallel to the ferromagnetic surface. Through a systematic study of various 10-nm-thick ferromagnetic layers, such as Ni, NiFe, Fe, and CoFeB, we find that while Fe and CoFeB exhibit minimal rectification, Ni and NiFe generate strong rectified signals that must be corrected. We further demonstrate that these rectification effects become negligible for ferromagnetic thicknesses $\\leq$ 6 nm, as validated in NiFe/Pt bilayers, providing an important guideline for the design of future heterostructures."}

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems."}

Powder X-ray diffraction is indexable in $R\\bar{3}$, and whole pattern modelling that includes layer glide faults indicates that the selective broadening can be captured by a first order Markov stacking description based on stochastic switching between two symmetry equivalent lateral stacking steps, with explicit model dependence and an uncertainty of at least several percent.

Here, we introduce a real-space theoretical framework in which FCIs are understood in terms of composite bosons, local objects consisting of electrons bound to their energetically excluded surrounding orbitals. The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms."}

In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $φ=π$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes.

A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $α$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor.

Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure."}

While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials.

AA stacking exhibits nearly double the cross-plane thermal conductivity of AB stacking, driven by longer acoustic phonon lifetimes from a more \"coherent\" interlayer registry.

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems."}

This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations.

For all superlattices under investigation, we find robust half-metallic ferromagnetism extending across all the layers of both component regions. Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. This study provides insights into the emergent magnetic phases and transition temperatures relevant to oxide heterostructures."}

Aluminium and its oxide (AlOx) have dominated cryogenic tunnel junction technology for decades due to the high quality of AlOx barriers and Al superconducting properties below 1.2 K. However, many applications require non-superconducting junctions, either standalone or in combination with superconducting technology, motivating efforts to suppress Al superconductivity through magnetic fields, doping, or proximity effects -- approaches that so far suffered from integration compatibility and scalability issues. Here, we present a CMOS-compatible normal-metal tunnel junction technology based on TiW alloy and AlOx barriers. We demonstrate wafer-scale fabrication of TiW/Al-AlOx/TiW junctions and validate their performance in Coulomb blockade thermometers operating down to 20 mK, confirming robust normal-state behavior. This TiW-based architecture offers a scalable solution for non-superconducting tunnel junctions across a broad temperature range, enabling integration into advanced cryogenic, quantum and nanoelectronic chip-level systems."}

Conventional RF approaches, which fabricate the Lenz lens onto the diamond anvil itself, preclude the placement of electrical circuits. Our method overcomes this limitation by transferring the RF sensor to a composite Ta-based gasket. The sensor consists of single-turn microcoils that are formed by magnetron sputtering a gold film onto an insulating Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer. The Lenz lens topology is then patterned using focused ion beam etching. We validated this technique using polycrystalline Cu1234 and Bi2212 high-$\\textit{T$_c$}$ superconductors at ambient and high pressures. The measurements consistently identified the superconducting transition temperature across carrier frequencies from 111 kHz to 200 MHz. This new gasket technique establishes a reliable and sensitive tool for contactless studies of superconductivity under high pressure."}
