These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant,\naccounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how\nthe stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show\nhow a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must\nrespect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein\nequation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant\nmust be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing\nfields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra\ndimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct\n4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological\nconstant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the\ndetails of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for\nthe stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also\nbriefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d\ntheory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains\nconsistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is\nreflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk."}

While\nthese fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small\nscales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave\nbackground observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the\ninflationary Hubble scale, $m\\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is\nflat. Meanwhile, if $m\\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted\nisocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but\navoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a\ncoincidence of scales $m\\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we\nshow that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary\ndynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted\nspectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically,\nif its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition\n$V''<3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the\nboundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to\n$H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of\n$e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived,\nthis mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which\nis insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar\nfield with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to\nconstitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses.

Lateral photoconductors generally require a large size, in the mm2, and\nare limited in operation speed due to the presence of trapping sites.

The prevailing understanding is\nthat the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long\nmean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,\nthereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat\neffectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture\nmode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon\npopulations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near\nNHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of\nlong-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons\nheat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient\nnear the NH and thereby enhancing TR. By resolving the spectral contributions\nto the phonon transport resistance and temperature gradients, we identify the\ncritical role of the modal specific heat in nonlocal phonon transport.

Two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials have become the most promising exploration target due to their\nexceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted\ndevice transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary\nsemiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The\nresults demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5.7 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still\nexhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and\nsurpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap\nfor Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve\nthe required on-state current of 900 {\\mu}A/{\\mu}m under low operating voltages\nof 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's\nsubthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching\nan astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor\nperformance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the\nchannel length is 7.9 nm.

Chalgogenide materials\nhave applications in phase change random access memory (PCRAM) due to their\nability to reversibly cycle between crystalline and amorphous states, and of\nthese materials Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is of particular interest due to its speed,\nstability and low crystallisation temperatures.

Early stage growth follows conserved KPZ scaling, forming\ntwo-dimensional islands and stanene layers.

Recent\noperando Raman and impedance measurements of the reaction suggested that the\nbulk region of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ acts as a reservoir of oxygen atoms that can\nmigrate to the surface to participate in catalysis. This conclusion was drawn\nfrom the observed significant reduction in Raman intensity during the catalytic\nprocess which implies the formation of atomic defects. However, the microscopic\norigin of this reduction remains to be clarified. In this work, we performed\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the origin of the\nexperimentally observed Raman intensity variation. Our phonon analysis reveals\nthat oxygen-dominated vibrational modes, with a small Mo contribution, occur\nnear 782 cm$^{-1}$-the same frequency region where the Raman intensity\nreduction was measured. Using an effective frozen-phonon approach, we further\ndemonstrate that oxygen vibrations are primarily responsible for the decrease\nin calculated Raman intensity. Moreover, structural relaxation of\nFe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ including an oxygen vacancy suggests that oxygen diffusion\nfrom the bulk to the surface should occur without significant alteration of the\nlocal symmetry, consistent with the absence of measurable peak shifts or\nbroadening in the experimental Raman spectra."}
