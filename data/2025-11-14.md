### [1] [Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10364)
*Anoop Dhillon,A. Hamed Majedi*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个微波增强超导的平衡量子模型。该模型解释了光子与库珀对的纠缠如何形成“微波修饰态”，从而在平衡态下增强超导性，并揭示了超导体对电磁场的反作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前描述微波增强超导的理论（如Eliashberg非平衡理论）主要基于非平衡态。本文旨在建立一个平衡态下的量子模型，以提供一个更根本的理论解释。

Method: 作者构建了一个理论模型，研究了超导凝聚体与量子化电磁场的耦合。通过分析光子-库珀对的纠缠效应，推导出了微波修饰态的形成及其能量结构。

Result: 1. 发现了因光子-库珀对纠缠而产生的“微波修饰态”。
2. 这些态的能量间隔超过了BCS理论的预测，且增强幅度与光子数和真空涨落有关。
3. 证明了超导凝聚体能反过来抑制电磁场的涨落（包括真空涨落）。

Conclusion: 本文成功建立了一个微波增强超导的平衡量子模型，为理解该现象提供了新的理论框架，并扩展了传统的非平衡理论。同时，模型揭示的超导体对电磁场的反作用，与介电质中场量子化理论相符。

Abstract: Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.

### [2] [The True Parent Phase of K1.9Fe4.2Se5: A Stripe-type Orthorhombic Phase Requiring a Superconducting Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10443)
*Chih-Han Wang,Jie-Yu Yang,Wu Phillip M,Gwo-Tzong Huang,Ming-Jye Wang,Maw-Kuen Wu*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: 本文发现A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2的高温超导性源于一个两步过程：首先形成一个本身不超导的“条纹”母相，然后该相发生结构畸变从而进入超导态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决为何A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2的超导转变温度（Tc > 30 K）远高于FeSe（8 K）这一核心问题，并澄清其真正的超导母相。

Method: 研究人员通过衍射实验，识别并分析了特定的衍射峰（d2峰和d1主峰），以区分材料中的不同物相，并确定从母相到超导相的转变特征。

Result: 实验发现：一个新的“条纹状正交相”（特征为d2峰）是高温超导的真正母相；该母相本身不超导；超导性仅在该母相经历后续结构畸变（特征为d1主峰的非对称增宽）后才会出现。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，材料中Tc的放大源于一个两步转变机制：首先形成一个条纹状的母相，随后发生一个导致超导的结构畸变。这一发现为通过“可控非均匀性”来提升超导转变温度提供了新的机制。

Abstract: The origin of the four-fold Tc amplification in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (>30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) remains a central puzzle, complicated by a debate over the true superconducting (SC) parent phase--the I4/m (245) insulating matrix or a supposed I4/mmm metallic phase. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel "stripe-type orthorhombic phase" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity.

### [3] [Electrostatic, Luminescent, and Paramagnetic Responses of Fresh BN Nanopowders Synthesized under Concentrated Light](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09662)
*Lina Sartinska*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 研究了在特定条件下合成的硼基纳米粉末，发现其初始具有的静电、光学和磁学特性在暴露于空气两年后因表面氧化而完全消失，揭示了表面化学对维持其功能特性的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探究在高温、非平衡条件下合成的纳米粉末的独特性质，并理解其表面化学状态如何随时间演变，以及这种演变对其静电、光学和磁学功能性的影响。

Method: 使用高通量光学炉，在氮气流中以硼粉为原料合成了纳米粉末。通过傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）和光致发光（PL）等方法，分析了粉末在合成初期和经过两年大气暴露后的结构与物性变化，并与商用氮化硼粉末进行对比。

Result: 新合成的纳米粉末具有核壳结构，并因表面缺陷而表现出显著的静电荷、光致发光和顺磁性。然而，在空气中放置两年后，这些特性完全消失。FTIR分析证实，粉末表面发生了渐进式的氧化和羟基化，这表明大气中的水分和氧气钝化了表面的缺陷态。

Conclusion: 该研究得出结论，表面化学在决定硼基纳米材料的静电、光学和磁学行为方面起着关键作用。大气暴露会导致表面缺陷的钝化，从而使材料失去其初始功能特性。因此，为了长期保持这些材料的功能，缺陷的稳定性至关重要。

Abstract: This study explores the properties of nanopowders synthesized under high-temperature, non-equilibrium conditions in a high-flux optical furnace in a nitrogen flow. Boron powders served as the starting material, and the intense thermal gradients during synthesis led to incomplete chemical reactions. As a result, the surface of the resulting nanoparticles is covered with a thin layer of sassolite, followed by boron oxides, beneath which lies a boron nitride shell. The subsurface contains boron-rich nitride phases, while the core consists of elemental boron. For reference, commercial platelet-like h-BN powders from the "Chempur" company were also analyzed. Initially, all synthesized nanopowders displayed pronounced electrostatic charging, photoluminescence (PL), and paramagnetic activity, attributable to high surface defect densities and unsaturated chemical bonds. However, after two years of exposure to ambient air, these nanopowders exhibited complete loss of electrostatic charging, absence of photoluminescence (PL), and disappearance of the characteristic single EPR resonance line. Similarly, commercial h-BN nanopowder from the "Chempur" company does not exhibit a single EPR resonance line too. FTIR analysis revealed progressive surface oxidation and hydroxylation of this powder, suggesting that atmospheric moisture and oxygen effectively passivated defect states. These findings underscore the critical role of surface chemistry in governing the electrostatic, optical, and magnetic behavior of BN-based nanomaterials and highlight the importance of defect stabilization for preserving functional properties over time.

Abstract: Coupled ionic and electronic transport underpins processes as diverse as electrochemical energy conversion, biological signaling, and soft adaptive electronics. Yet, how chemical environments such as pH modulate this coupling at the molecular scale remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the protonation state of carboxylated polythiophenes provides precise chemical control over ion dynamics, doping efficiency, solvent uptake and mechanical response. The findings establish molecular acidity as a general strategy to program ionic preference and mechanical stability, offering design principles for pH-responsive mixed conductors and soft electronic materials that couple ionic, electronic, and mechanical functionality.

Abstract: Understanding how protective oxide scales evolve over time is necessary for improving the long term resistance of superalloys. This work investigates the time-dependent oxidation behavior of an ingot-processable Co/Ni-based superalloy oxidized in air at $800~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $20$, $100$, and $1000~\mathrm{h}$ . Mass-gain and white-light interferometry measurements quantified oxidation kinetics, surface roughness, and spallation, while high-resolution STEM-EDX characterized oxide morphology and nanoscale elemental partitioning. Atom probe tomography captured the key transition regions between the chromia and alumina scales, and X-ray diffraction was used to identify a gradual transition from NiO and (Ni,Co)-spinel phases to a compact, dual phase chromia and alumina-rich scale. The oxidation rate evolved from near-linear to parabolic behavior with time, consistent with diffusion-controlled growth once a continuous Cr$_2$O$_3$/$α$-Al$_2$O$_3$ scale formed. These observations help link kinetics, structure and chemistry, showing how an originally porous spinel layer transforms into a dense, adherent chromia + alumina scale that provides long-term protection in wrought Co/Ni-based superalloys.

Motivation: 铂族催化剂成本高昂，因此需要开发低成本的过渡金属高熵纳米合金作为可持续的替代品。本文旨在通过利用这类材料的亚稳态特性来提升其电催化性能。

Method: 首先，在有机溶剂中使用纳秒脉冲激光合成法制备碳掺杂的Cantor非晶态高熵合金纳米颗粒。然后，通过原位电子显微镜观察，在加热至600°C时，对这些纳米颗粒进行退火处理。

Conclusion: 该研究证明，通过合成后退火处理来策略性地利用高熵纳米合金的相亚稳态，是增强激光制备的纳米颗粒电化学活性的有效方法。

Abstract: Low-cost transition metal high-entropy nanoalloys are emerging as sustainable alternatives to platinum group electrocatalysts. Synthesis conditions of single-phase solid solutions can alter phase stability, causing surface composition changes that affect electrocatalytic performance. Here, we propose to exploit the metastability of carbon-doped Cantor alloy-based amorphous high-entropy alloy nanoparticles produced by nanosecond-pulsed laser synthesis in organic solvents. In situ electron microscopy reveals crystallization and partitioning of elements upon heating to 600 °C, forming heterostructured nanoparticles with reinforced carbon shells that exhibit a 5- to 7-fold enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity compared to the as-synthesized counterparts for the oxygen evolution reaction. We demonstrate the strategic utilization of phase metastability in high-entropy nanoalloys through post-synthesis annealing to enhance the electrochemical activity of laser-generated nanoparticles.

Abstract: Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are ubiquitous in ordered Heusler alloys and strongly influence magnetic coercivity in Ni-Mn-Ga, yet the link between their atomic-scale exchange interactions and micrometer-scale magnetic contrast measured by magnetic force microscopy (MFM) remains unclear. We combine density functional theory (DFT) and finite-element magnetostatics to bridge these scales in Ni-Mn-Ga. DFT calculations on supercells containing planar APBs show that the lowest-energy configuration comprises a pair of parallel APBs enclosing a nanoscale region - only three Mn-Ga atomic layers thick - whose magnetization is antiparallel to the surrounding matrix due to strong antiferromagnetic exchange across each APB (in contrast to ferromagnetic coupling in bulk martensite). According to our magnetostatic finite element model, this thin region with antiparallel magnetization generates the characteristic MFM contrast extending approx. 100 nm from the APB pair. When the APBs are further apart than 50 nm, dipole-dipole penalties outweigh exchange gains, preventing formation of an extended antiparallel domain, in agreement with experimental evidence. These results identify APB pairs as the origin of the observed MFM contrast and offer an interpretation of the modest strengths of domain-wall pinning by APBs, informing the design of magnetic shape-memory alloys with tailored coercivity.

Abstract: Alloying compound AX with another compound BX is widely used to tune material properties. For disordered alloys, due to the lack of periodicity, it has been challenging to calculate and study their material properties. Special quasi-random structure (SQS) method has been developed and widely used to treat this issue by matching averaged atomic correlation functions to those of ideal random alloys, enabling accurate predictions of macroscopic material properties such as total energy and volume. However, in AxB1-x alloys, statistically allowed local concentration fluctuations can give rise to defect-like minority configurations, such as bulk-like AX or BX regions in the extreme, which could strongly affect calculation of some of the material properties such as semiconductor bandgap, if it is not defined properly, leading to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, taking the bandgap as an example, we demonstrate that the calculated alloy bandgap can be significantly underestimated in standard SQS calculations when the SQS cell size is increased to improve the structural model and the bandgap is defined conventionally as the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state, because the rare event motifs can lead to wavefunction localization and become the dominant factor in determining the "bandgap", contrary to experiment. To be consistent with experiment, we show that the bandgap of the alloy should be extracted from the majority configurations using a density-of-states fitting (DOSF) method. This DOSF approach resolves the long-standing issue of calculating electronic structure of disordered semiconductor alloys. Similar approaches should also be developed to treat material properties that depends on localized alloy wavefunctions.

Abstract: While Si clathrates have been explored as promising direct bandgap semiconductors, their practical optoelectronic performance has been limited by high doping levels and structural defects. Hydrogen has long been used to improve the optoelectronic quality of conventional Si, yet its role in clathrate structures remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that hydrogen (deuterium) can be incorporated into type II Si clathrate framework using remote plasma treatment. This process leads to the formation of NaD and SiD complexes, which significantly reduce both the Na donor density and dangling bond defects. Electron paramagnetic resonance confirms nearly a tenfold decrease in Na-related donor states, resulting in the lowest doping level reported in Si clathrates to date. Following passivation, the integrated photoluminescence intensity increases by a factor of 40, accompanied by a blue shift of the main emission peak, consistent with a transition closer to the intrinsic band edge. A new emission peak at 930 nm, attributed to hydrogen-related recombination centers, also appears. These improvements remain stable up to 400 oC. Altogether, this work establishes hydrogen passivation as a viable strategy for enhancing light emission in Si clathrates and opens a new pathway toward their application in Si-based light-emitting diodes and other direct-bandgap optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Advances in the development of flexible piezoelectric and thermoelectric materials have provided an important avenue for the exploration of energy scavenging through the thermodynamic-coupling of orthogonal energy-scavenging modalities. This has led to a body of work creating hybrid thermo/piezo-electric generator devices (T/PEGs) in which the two effects become thermodynamically entangled. Based on hetero- thin film architectures, such devices can exhibit a surprising power generation characteristic which is non-additive between the two energy-scavenging effects. For example, when the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects are strongly coupled by their proximal fields, the efficacy of energy scavenging can be made to exceed that of the two effects independently. In this review of such effects, a basic coupled heat engine model is shown to provide insight into the origins of synergistic power generation. These models however, suggest the emergence of other combined thermodynamic properties such as the kinetic Peltier-Caloric Effect (PCE) traced to Onsager reciprocity. The recent observation of this effect in multicomponent systems is confirmation of the limited perspective of thermodynamic separability.

Abstract: We demonstrate a zero-bias ultraviolet (UV) detector using zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films as the active semiconductor layer, specifically for application in cryogenic conditions. The zero-bias device utilizes the piezoelectric potential developed through interfacial stress in the active semiconductor layer for charge transport. We explored two vertically stacked metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configurations: Sample I, a device comprised of chromium (Cr)/ZnO/Cr layers, and Sample II, a ZnO-silicon nitride (Si3N4) device comprised of Cr/Si3N4/ZnO/Cr layers. The Si3N4 layer in Sample II was introduced in the form of pillars, with the aim of increasing the residual stress in the active region. These fabricated devices were tested at both room and cryogenic temperatures to characterize their UV-detection performance in a custom test stand using a 365 nm UV LED source. We observe a higher UV-induced voltage signal for Sample II in comparison to Sample I at both temperature regimes. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements showed approximately 40% higher residual stress in Sample II than in Sample I. A higher residual stress suggests a higher induced piezopotential in Sample II, explaining the enhancement in the UV-induced signal. Our results demonstrate that through appropriate in-device stress engineering, UV photoinduced signals can be enhanced, increasing detector sensitivity. A zero-bias photodetector with in-device stress engineering, as demonstrated here, can have applications in extreme environments, like cryogenic liquid noble elements or high radiation space environments, where low or zero-power detection may be required.

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.

Abstract: Periodic metallic gratings on substrates can support a range of electromagnetic modes, such as leaky waveguide, guided-resonant, and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity modes, which can strongly modulate optical transmission under resonant excitation. Here, we investigate how this coupling can be dynamically manipulated through charge-density control in a laterally patterned AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The structure comprises metallic stripes separated by regions containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), forming a periodically modulated interface whose electromagnetic response is governed by the charge density between the stripes. In the unbiased state, the conductive 2DEG screens the incident terahertz field and suppresses excitation of guided modes. When the 2DEG is depleted, the change in boundary conditions allows efficient coupling into substrate resonances, producing a strong modulation at particular frequencies where extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through the structure takes place. The results highlight the sensitive dependence of guided-mode-resonance (GMR) mediated EOT on inter-stripe charge distribution and demonstrate a direct interplay between carrier dynamics and resonant electromagnetic phenomena in the terahertz regime.

Abstract: Tuneable capacitors are vital for adaptive and reconfigurable electronics, yet existing approaches require continuous bias or mechanical actuation. Here we demonstrate a voltage-programmable ferroelectric memcapacitor based on HfZrO that achieves more than eight stable, reprogrammable capacitance states (3-bit encoding) within a non-volatile window of 24~pF. The device switches at low voltages (3~V), with each state exhibiting long retention (10^5~s) and high endurance (10^6 cycles), ensuring reliable multi-level operation. At the nanoscale, multistate charge retention was directly visualised using atomic force microscopy, confirming the robustness of individual states beyond macroscopic measurements. As a proof of concept, the capacitor was integrated into a high-pass filter, where the programmed capacitive states shift the cutoff frequency over 5~kHz, establishing circuit-level viability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of CMOS-compatible, non-volatile, analogue memory based on ferroelectric HfZrO, paving the way for adaptive RF filters, reconfigurable analogue front-ends, and neuromorphic electronics.

TL;DR: 本研究利用机器学习加速的多尺度模拟，揭示了硝酸盐电还原为氨（NO3RR）过程中Cu(111)催化剂表面的动态变化。研究发现，催化活性位点并非单一结构，而是一个由多种吸附物构型组成的动态集合。通过调控电势可以改变这些构型的分布，从而实现最高的催化活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电催化反应过程中，催化剂表面不断重构，这使得确定真实的活性位点变得非常困难，从而阻碍了催化剂的理性设计。本研究旨在阐明在实际工作条件下，铜表面在硝酸盐还原反应中的动态行为。

Method: 研究团队采用了一种由机器学习势函数加速的多尺度模拟框架，来解析硝酸盐-氨电还原（NO3RR）过程中Cu(111)电解质界面的动态结构，并分析了超过150个过渡态的反应动力学。

Result: 研究发现，工作界面并非单一的“平均覆盖”位点，而是34种可相互转换的吸附物基序的统计系综。电势的变化驱动了这些基序数量的改变，从而产生了一个在-0.70V时达到峰值的火山形活性曲线，此时法拉第效率接近100%。最高的活性来源于一个特定的“2NO/2NH2四边形微观系综”，它通过优化界面电荷，同时降低了N-O键断裂和N-H键形成的能垒。

Conclusion: 本文提出将催化剂的“覆盖度”重新概念化为一个动态的局部微环境系综，这使得热力学稳定性与催化产率可以解耦。该视角提供了一种无参数的策略，即通过电势来控制吸附物基序的数量和界面电荷，从而为设计超越NO3RR的高覆盖度电催化剂提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electrocatalyst surfaces continuously reorganize on the timescale of catalytic turnover, obscuring the identification of active sites under operando conditions and hindering rational catalyst design. Here, we resolve the operando Cu(111) electrolyte interface for nitrate-to-ammonia electroreduction (NO3RR) via a multiscale modeling framework accelerated by a coverage-aware machine-learning potential. Rather than a single "average coverage" site, the working interface is a potential-gated statistical ensemble of 34 interconverting adsorbate motifs between -0.10 and -1.00 V (vs. SHE). Potential-driven shifts in motif populations produce a volcano-shaped activity trend peaking at -0.70 V, where the site-normalized turnover frequency reaches 0.015 s-1 with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency to ammonia. The activation barriers across >150 transition states collapse into a single linear relationship with the excess charge on the reacting Cu atoms (ΔqCu), identifying interfacial charge redistribution as a unifying kinetic descriptor. The maximum activity arises not from uniform moderate coverage but from a 2NO/2NH2 quadrilateral microensemble that tunes ΔqCu to an intermediate value, simultaneously lowering the N-O cleavage and N-H formation barriers. Reconceptualizing "coverage" as an ensemble of local microenvironments decouples thermodynamic stability from catalytic productivity. This perspective furnishes a parameter-free strategy by controlling motif populations and interfacial charge via the potential to program high-coverage electrocatalysis beyond the NO3RR.

Abstract: Constitutive models are fundamental to solid mechanics and materials science, underpinning the quantitative description and prediction of material responses under diverse loading conditions. Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena.

Abstract: The planar hexagonal phase of ZnO, known as h-ZnO, g-ZnO, alpha-ZnO, the Bk structure, the 5-5 phase, the alpha-BN phase, etc., has P63/mmc symmetry and is implicated in ferroelectric switching mechanisms for wurtzite-ZnO. It is well-known in thin films on substrates, to be pressure stabilized, etc., but critical is its possible existence in high-purity nanocrystals under ambient conditions. Indeed, a crystal structure has been reported, but this work remains controversial as first-principles calculations predict very different structural properties. Herein, the original experimental data is re-refined, using more sophisticated techniques, to yield lattice parameters of a = 3.45+/-0.02 Å and c = 4.46+/-0.02 Å that are 0.35 Å and 0.80 Å, respectively, larger than those previously reported and in good agreement with computational predictions. This confirms that ZnO can form a metastable planar hexagonal phase. It provides key information pertaining to polarization switching in ZnO, its derivatives, and general wurtzite-structured materials.

Abstract: Electric field-induced studies, including phase transition and polarization hysteresis, for ferroelectric HfO2 at the atomic scale are critical since they can largely affect its application in ferroelectric and dielectric devices. However, conventional first-principles approaches are computationally limited in capturing large-scale atomic dynamics under realistic field conditions. Here, to enable electric-field-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we develop a machine learning potential (MLP) tailored for HfO2, coupled with an in-situ Born effective charge (BEC) model. This framework enables us to capture key phenomena, including field-induced phase transitions, polarization switching, and strain-dependent dielectric responses, with high fidelity and computational efficiency. Notably, we reproduce hysteresis loops and phase transition barriers consistent with AIMD results and reveal possible electric-field-induced polarization activation in the monoclinic phase. Our approach offers a scalable and transferable tool for atomistic exploration of functional oxides and paves the way for data-driven design of ferroelectric devices.

Abstract: Dual-absorber solar cells represent a promising approach to surpass the efficiency limit of single-junction devices by extending spectral absorption and minimizing thermalization losses. Among earth-abundant thin-film materials, kesterites have attracted considerable interest, however, the well-studied Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) continues to face challenges related to antisite disorder and secondary phase formation. Replacing Zn with Mn in Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) mitigates these limitations, improving cation ordering and electronic quality while maintaining favorable optical properties. Yet, despite its potential, CMTS remains largely unexplored in multi-absorber configurations-only one prior study has reported a CMTS-based dual-absorber device. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of a CMTS-FeSi2 dual-absorber thin-film solar cell using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). FeSi2, with its narrow band gap (0.87 eV) and strong near-infrared absorption, serves as an ideal bottom absorber to complement CMTS, enabling broader spectral utilization. The study systematically examines the effects of geometrical, electronic, and interfacial parameters on carrier transport, and overall device performance. The optimized device delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency of 34.9%, with VOC = 0.79 V, JSC = 51.07 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 85.91%. These findings demonstrate that integrating FeSi2 with CMTS not only enhances carrier collection and spectral harvesting but also establishes a new pathway toward high-efficiency, sustainable, and environmentally benign thin-film photovoltaics.

Abstract: Half metals, which are amenable to perfect spin filtering, can be utilized for high-magnetoresistive devices. However, available half metals are very limited. Here, we demonstrate that materials with intrinsic spin-valley-mismatched (SVM) states can be used to block charge transport, resembling half metals and leading to giant tunneling magnetoresistance. As an example, by using first-principles transport calculations, we show that ferromagnetic 1\emph{T}-VSe$_2$, 1\emph{T}-VS$_2$, and 2\emph{H}-VS$_2$ are such spin-valley-mismatched metals, and giant magnetoresistance of more than 99\% can be realized in spin-valve van der Waals (vdW) junctions using these metals as electrodes. Owing to the intrinsic mismatch of spin states, the central-layer materials for the vdW junctions can be arbitrary nonmagnetic materials, in principle. Our research provides clear physical insights into the mechanism for high magnetoresistance and opens new avenues for the search and design of high-magnetoresistance devices.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种在GaAs基板上外延生长可剥离的单晶GaAs薄膜的方法，通过引入图形化的石墨烯中间层，实现了高质量的GaAs生长，为III-V族太阳能电池基板的重复利用提供了可能，从而降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低高效III-V族太阳能电池的制造成本，具体方法是实现昂贵的GaAs基板的重复使用。

Method: 该方法在(001)GaAs基板上先生长一层石墨烯，然后对石墨烯进行图形化处理。接着，采用分子束外延（MBE）技术分两步生长GaAs层：第一步是在石墨烯的开口区域进行选择性区域生长，然后通过调制镓（Ga）通量进行横向外延过生长，直到薄膜完全合并；第二步是在薄膜合并后，在连续的Ga供应下进行常规生长。

Result: 研究发现，石墨烯图案相对于其下方GaAs基板晶体学方向的取向会影响GaAs的形貌和质量。当图案沿[1__10]+22.5°方向、石墨烯覆盖率为50%时，获得了最佳结果，GaAs层的粗糙度显著降低至3.3纳米。

Conclusion: 研究成功证明，通过在图形化的石墨烯层上进行两步外延生长，可以在GaAs基板上获得高质量的单晶GaAs层。优化的图案方向和覆盖率是获得平滑表面的关键，这为实现基板再利用以降低III-V太阳能电池成本提供了一种可行途径。

Abstract: Re-using the substrate is identified as a method for reducing the cost of high efficiency III-V solar cells. The approach investigated here consists in inserting a graphene layer onto a (001)GaAs substrate prior to the epitaxial growth of GaAs. To obtain a monocrystalline GaAs grown layer, the graphene layer is patterned, followed by a two-step epitaxial growth, here performed by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The first step is a selective area growth of GaAs in graphene openings, followed by a lateral overgrowth, under a modulated Ga flux. The second step, after reaching coalescence, consists in a regular growth under continuous Ga supply. It is observed that the pattern orientations relative to the crystallographic direction of the GaAs substrate below the graphene have an influence on GaAs morphology and quality. The best result was obtained for patterns oriented along [1__10]+22.5{\textdegree} with a graphene coverage of 50%, with a significantly reduced roughness down to 3.3 nm.

Abstract: Scientific data across physics, materials science, and materials engineering often lacks adherence to FAIR principles (Barker et al., 2022; Jacobsen et al., 2020; M. D. Wilkinson et al., 2016; S. R. Wilkinson et al., 2025) due to incompatible instrument-specific formats and diverse standardization practices. pynxtools is a Python software development framework with a command line interface (CLI) that standardizes data conversion for scientific experiments in materials science to the NeXus format (Klosowski et al., 1997; Könnecke, 2006; Könnecke et al., 2015) across diverse scientific domains. NeXus defines data storage specifications for different experimental techniques through application definitions. pynxtools provides a fixed, versioned set of NeXus application definitions that ensures convergence and alignment in data specifications across, among others, atom probe tomography, electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Through its modular plugin architecture pynxtools provides conversion of data and metadata from instruments and electronic lab notebooks to these unified definitions, while performing validation to ensure data correctness and NeXus compliance. pynxtools can be integrated directly into Research Data Management Systems (RDMS) to facilitate parsing and normalization. We detail one example for the RDM system NOMAD. By simplifying the adoption of NeXus, the framework enables true data interoperability and FAIR data management across multiple experimental techniques.

Abstract: Forced excitations at frequencies in the range of the first order azimuthal spin waves of a magnetic disk in the vortex state are known to scatter into the vortex gyration mode, thereby allowing the growth of Floquet spin waves forming a frequency comb. We study the temporal emergence of this dynamical state using time-resolved microwave electrical measurements. The most intense Floquet mode emerges synchronously with the gyration mode after a common incubation delay which diverges at the scattering threshold. This delay is minimal when the drive is resonant with one of the first order azimuthal spin waves. It can be as short as 3 ns for the maximum investigated power. We conclude that the first-to-occur scattering mechanism is the three-wave splitting of a regular azimuthal eigenmode into a coherent pair formed by a gyration magnon and a Floquet spin wave.

Abstract: The discovery of advanced metallic alloys is hindered by vast composition spaces, competing property objectives, and real-world constraints on manufacturability. Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.

Abstract: We investigate the single crystals of Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, revealing that Ni intercalation profoundly alters the physical properties of NbSe$_2$. Magnetic measurements clearly show that the system is magnetically frustrated with antiferromagnetic ordering below 23.5\,K, with an irreversibility temperature near 10\,K, and a magnetic hysteresis with a small net magnetic moment. Overall, the system can be described as an inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic phase with magnetic disorder and magnetic frustration. We found two Curie-Weiss temperatures of -80\,K for the field in the {\it ab}-plane and -137\,K for the field out of plane, which are a consequence of anisotropic interactions in spin space and favor an orientation of the spin along the {\it c}-axis. Temperature-dependent resistivity shows a complete suppression of both charge density waves and superconducting order down to 300\,mK. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 84\,K reveals a $\overlineΓ$-centered electron pocket in Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, which is absent in pristine NbSe$_2$. The electronic structure results show a shift of the van Hove singularity (VHS), which is the main cause of the suppression of the electronic orders. These results align with recent theoretical predictions that Ni intercalation with cationic disorder favors frustrated antiferromagnetic stripe states, shifts the VHS and reconstructs the Fermi surface in NbSe$_2$. Our findings position Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$ within a magnetically frustrated, non-superconducting regime, highlighting how partial intercalation and disorder drive complex magnetic order and the Fermi surface reconstruction in low-dimensional quantum materials.

Abstract: Earth-abundant materials exhibiting Mie resonances across the visible and near-infrared offer opportunities for efficient and sustainable sensing, thermal regulation, and sunlight harvesting. For anatase TiO$_2$, a broadband optical and abundant material, Mie calculations indicate that robust resonances require size tunability and monodispersity (standard deviation, $\lesssim$ 5\%) over an extended range (0.5-2 $μ$m) not yet experimentally covered, while maintaining a refractive index above 2 to ensure optical contrast, for example with biomolecules. Here, we demonstrate that a simple UV-assisted thermal hydrolysis route yields anatase particles that meet all these criteria and remain aqueous-processable. Consequently, the materials display intense and modulable Mie resonances across the visible/near-infrared regions (including biological windows), outperforming previous results that were limited by size. Strong optical resonances combined with ambient-temperature processability enable robust, broadband, label-free detection of transparent biomolecules. Our insights advance precise synthesis and Mie-based photonics of an earth-abundant material, and indicate the potential for cost-effective and rapid-on-demand integration via printing technologies, further enhanced by anatase's biocompatibility and photochemical properties.

Abstract: Phase-field (PF) simulation provides a powerful framework for predicting microstructural evolution but suffers from prohibitive computational costs that severely limit accessible spatiotemporal scales in practical applications. While data-driven methods have emerged as promising approaches for accelerating PF simulations, existing methods require extensive training data from numerous evolution trajectories, and their inherent black-box nature raises concerns about long-term prediction reliability. This work demonstrates, through examples of grain growth and spinodal decomposition, that a minimalist Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with a remarkably small dataset even from a single small-scale simulation can achieve seamless scalability to larger systems and reliable long-term predictions far beyond the temporal range of the training data. The key insight of this work lies in revealing that the success of CNN-based models stems from the alignment between their inductive biases and the physical priors of phase-field simulations specifically, locality and spatiotemporal translation invariance. Through effective receptive field analysis, we verify that the model captures these essential properties during training. Therefore, from a reductionist perspective, the surrogate model essentially establishes a spatiotemporally invariant regression mapping between a grid point's local environment and its subsequent state. Further analysis of the model's feature space demonstrates that microstructural evolution effectively represents a continuous redistribution of a finite set of local environments. When the model has already encountered nearly all possible local environments in the early-stage training data, it can reliably generalize to much longer evolution timescales, regardless of the dramatic changes in global microstructural morphology.

Abstract: In this work, a dual-mode luminescent thermometer operating via both ratiometric and lifetime-based readout strategies was developed, enabled by the coexistence of two thermally driven effects: a structural phase transition in LiYO2 and a phonon-assisted energy transfer from Yb3+ to Nd3+. As demonstrated, changes in the shape of the emission band of Yb3+ ions corresponding to the 2F5/2 -> 2F7/2 electronic transition, induced by the phase transition, enabled the design of a ratiometric thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity (SR) of 3.1% K^-1 for LiYO2 doped with 10% Yb3+ and 1% Nd3+ at 290 K. In contrast, the temperature-dependent Yb3+ -> Nd3+ energy transfer facilitated the development of a lifetime-based thermometer with a maximum SR of 1.5% K^-1 for 20% Nd3+ at 378 K. In both approaches, tuning the Nd3+ concentration allowed modulation of both the sensitivity and the temperature at which the maximum SR occurred. This was achieved by shifting the phase transition temperature and increasing the probability of interionic energy transfer, respectively.
  Notably, the temperature ranges corresponding to the maximum SR for the ratiometric and lifetime modes were distinct, effectively broadening the thermal operating window of the sensor. Additionally, it was shown that LiYO2 doped with Nd3+ and Yb3+ can also be used as a temperature sensor through the ratio of luminescence intensities recorded at two different time gates. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the phonon-assisted energy transfer process plays the dominant role in shaping the luminescence kinetics, surpassing the influence of the structural phase transition. Overall, this study identifies LiYO2:Nd3+,Yb3+ as a promising candidate for multimodal luminescent temperature sensing applications.

Abstract: Understanding degradation processes in lithium ion batteries is essential for improving long term performance and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising anode material due to the high theoretical capacity of tin. Unlike conventional intercalation based electrodes, SnSe undergoes conversion and alloying reactions with lithium to form Li4.4Sn, Sn, and Li2Se, enabling high lithium storage but inducing large volume changes that cause mechanical instability and capacity fading. Embedding SnSe nanoparticles within a Ti3C2Tx MXene framework offers a strategy to mitigate these effects by enhancing conductivity and structural resilience. Here, cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo FIB) slice and view revealed progressive material redistribution and morphological transformation during cycling, underscoring the need for site specific chemical analysis. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo APT) of selected regions provided high spatial and chemical resolution while preserving beam sensitive phases, uncovering nanoscale degradation mechanisms including phase transformations, partial dissolution of active material, and, importantly, the first direct evidence of copper corrosion and copper ion migration from the current collector into the electrode. The observation of copper redistribution demonstrates that current collector degradation contributes directly to chemical contamination and capacity fading in composite electrodes. Together, cryo FIB and cryo APT provide a powerful workflow for elucidating electrode degradation in reactive, beam sensitive systems, offering critical insights for designing more durable and stable next generation battery materials.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in orbitronics, generating out-of-plane orbital torques essential for field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization remains a key challenge. Here, we propose a strategy to produce such unconventional torques across broad classes of materials, by leveraging the nonlinear orbital Hall effect. We demonstrate that this nonlinear orbital response is dramatically amplified by topological band degeneracies, where it overwhelmingly dominates the spin response even in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. These features are confirmed via a quantitative investigation of representative topological metals RhSi, YPtBi, and PbTaSe$_2$, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations. The resulting orbital torques substantially surpass those from linear mechanisms reported thus far. These findings propel the research of orbital transport into the nonlinear regime, broaden the scope of orbital source materials, and establish a new pathway towards high-performance orbitronic devices.

Abstract: Linear and non-linear couplings of magnetic and lattice excitations are at the heart of many fascinating magnetophononic phenomena observed in rare-earth orthoferrites, the distinctive feature of which is the tendency to spin-reorientation transitions. Here we report the results of the experimental study of the spin and lattice dynamics in the Brillouin zone center of the rare-earth orthoferrite Sm$_{0.55}$Tb$_{0.45}$FeO$_{3}$ by using polarized infrared reflectivity and Raman scattering spectroscopic techniques. The obtained results were supported by the first-principles calculations, which allowed us to reliably identify the parameters of most infrared- and Raman-active phonons. We reveal the spin-reorientation transitions $Γ_{4}(G_{a}F_{c}) \overset{T_{1}}\longleftrightarrow Γ_{24}(G_{ac}F_{ac}) \overset{T_{2}}\longleftrightarrow Γ_{2}(G_{c}F_{a})$ at $T_{1} \simeq 220$ K and $T_{2} \simeq 130$ K and carefully studied the following evolution of Raman scattering on magnetic excitations at these transitions. Notably, the intermediate magnetic structure $Γ_{24}$ displays an exceptionally broad temperature range $Δ{T} = T_{1} - T_{2} \simeq 90$ K in mixed Sm$_{0.55}$Tb$_{0.45}$FeO$_{3}$ compared to pure rare-earth orthoferrites. We attribute this broadening of the intermediate phase to the modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a result of the inhomogeneous magnetic structure caused by the random distribution of rare-earth $\mathrm{Sm}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Tb}^{3+}$ ions. We found neither change in the parameters of Raman-active $B_{1g}$ phonons nor the appearance of new phonons induced by spin-reorientation transitions, which have been reported in $\mathrm{SmFeO}_{3}$. We assume that our results provide a solid basis for more deeper understanding of magnetophononic phenomena in rare-earth orthoferrites.

Abstract: Ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics are the electric counterparts of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These materials undergo temperature- and electric-field-induced phase transitions that give rise to their characteristic hysteresis loops. Modeling such hysteresis loops and associated phase transitions enables both a deeper fundamental understanding and reliable property predictions for this important class of materials. To date, modeling has largely relied on classical approaches, often remaining qualitative and/or empirical. Traditional interpretation of these transitions rests on two assumptions: (i) they are activated Arrhenius-type processes and (ii) they occur well within the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate that a model can instead be built on two ''orthogonal`` assumptions: (i) the phase transitions are relaxational processes and (ii) they require a quantum mechanical treatment. Applying this model to both antiferroelectrics and ferroelectrics overcomes the limitations of traditional models and enables efficient first-principles simulations of phase transitions. Furthermore, the success of our unconventional approach highlights the significance of quantum mechanics in transitions long regarded as purely classical. We anticipate that this framework will be applicable to a broad range of phase transitions, including magnetic, elastic, multiferroic, and electronic, along with modeling of quantum tunneling, rates of chemical reactions, and others.

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同薄膜的表面闪络电压，发现氮化硅（SiN）和氮化铝（AlN）的性能远超二氧化硅（SiO₂）。

Motivation: 本文旨在探究二氧化硅（SiO₂）、氮化硅（SiN）和氮化铝（AlN）这三种薄膜在微米尺度上的表面闪络电压阈值。

Method: 研究人员测量并比较了二氧化硅（SiO₂）、氮化硅（SiN）和氮化铝（AlN）薄膜的表面闪络电压。此外，他们还使用不同的化学品对二氧化硅样品进行蚀刻，以评估其影响。

Result: 研究发现，氮化硅（SiN）和氮化铝（AlN）的性能明显优于所有二氧化硅（SiO₂）样品。在5微米的距离下，其表面闪络电压提高了45%，且随着电极间距增加，优势愈发明显。不同的蚀刻处理对二氧化硅的性能没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 在微米尺度上，氮化硅（SiN）和氮化铝（AlN）具有比二氧化硅（SiO₂）更高的表面闪络电压，是更优异的绝缘材料。对二氧化硅的表面蚀刻处理并不能有效提升其抗闪络性能。

Abstract: We investigate the surface flashover voltage threshold for SiO$_2$, SiN, and AlN thin films over micrometre scale lengths. Furthermore, we test the effects of different etching chemistries on SiO$_2$ layers. We find that there is little significant difference between untreated SiO$_2$ samples and those that have been etched with hydrogen fluoride or Transene AlPad Etch 639. SiN and AlN samples performed significantly better than all SiO$_2$ samples giving a 45% increase in surface flashover voltage at a distance of 5 $μ$m with the difference increasing with electrode spacing.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) in-plane heterostructures including compositionally graded alloys and lateral heterostructures with defined interfaces display rich optoelectronic properties and offer versatile platforms to explore one-dimensional interface physics and many-body interaction effects. Graded \(\mathrm{Mo}_x\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_2\) alloys show smooth spatial variations in composition and strain that continuously tune excitonic emission, while \(\mathrm{MoS}_2\)--\(\mathrm{WS}_2\) lateral heterostructures contain atomically sharp interfaces supporting one-dimensional excitonic phenomena. These single-layer systems combine tunable optical and electronic properties with potential for stable, high-performance optoelectronic devices. Hyperspectral and nano-resolved photoluminescence (PL) imaging enable spatial mapping of optical features along with local variations in composition, strain, and defects, but manual interpretation of such large datasets is slow and subjective. Here, we introduce a fast and scalable unsupervised machine-learning (ML) framework to extract quantitative and interpretable information from hyperspectral PL datasets of graded \(\mathrm{Mo}_x\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_2\) alloys and \(\mathrm{MoS}_2\)--\(\mathrm{WS}_2\) heterostructures. Combining principal-component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and density-based spatial clustering (DBSCAN), we uncover spectrally distinct domains associated with composition, strain, and defect variations. Decomposition of representative spectra reveals multiple emission species, including band-edge excitons and defect-related transitions, demonstrating that ML-driven analysis provides a robust and automated route to interpret rich optical properties of 2D materials.

Conclusion: 本文成功地在可测量的物理量（如吸收率、返回振幅）与1+1维无能隙系统的量子几何（特别是量子度规）之间建立了普适的、仅依赖于中心荷的直接联系。

Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.

Abstract: Intense quantum fluctuations arising from geometrical frustrations in kagome-lattice magnets provide a feasible approach to exotic quantum states. Here, we document an unexpected isosymmetric first-order magnetic transition in the recently synthesized frustrated kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Nd3ScBi5, which is characterized by significant latent heat and a pronounced magnetocaloric effect, as well as discontinuous Raman shifts and negligible hysteresis. Employing the magnetocaloric effect as a detection method, in conjunction with systematical field-dependent physical properties, we uncover a distinctive 1/2 magnetization plateau phase with significant quantum fluctuations. Our study unveils Nd3ScBi5 as a prototypical model with an emerging phase of enhanced quantum fluctuations triggered by first-order magnetic transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氧化物界面二维电子气（2DEG）因其在自旋电子学和量子信息技术中的巨大应用潜力而备受关注，本研究旨在探索这类材料中的量子输运现象。

Method: 研究人员在铁磁性EuTiO3 (ETO)薄膜和(111)取向的KTaO3 (KTO)衬底界面上构建了自旋极化的二维电子气（2DEG）。他们通过测量反常霍尔效应、磁阻等手段来研究其量子输运特性，并利用光激发进行调控。

Result: 研究发现，该二维电子气中存在长程铁磁序，并因此产生了非平凡的贝里相位，导致了弱局域化（WL）和弱反局域化（WAL）之间的竞争。更重要的是，这种竞争行为可以通过光栅进行有效调控。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一个基于自旋极化氧化物二维电子气的可控量子输运平台，为自旋轨道电子学和拓扑电子学的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Quantum transport phenomena in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces have garnered significant interest owing to their potential in spintronic and quantum information technologies. Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate a controllable platform based on spin-polarized oxide 2DEGs for quantum transport, opening new avenues for spin-orbitronic and topological electronic applications.

Motivation: 在量子模拟器中实现的强关联拓扑绝缘体难以用传统输运测量等方法进行探测，因此需要新的实验可行的探测方案。

Method: 作者提出了一种统一的协议，通过测量大子区域A内的总电荷算符相关的“失序参数” ⟨exp(iθQ_A)⟩ 来识别拓扑相。他们将此方法应用于两种关联拓扑绝缘体：一种是玻色子拓扑绝缘体，另一种是费米子量子自旋霍尔绝缘体。

Result: 研究发现，对于强关联拓扑绝缘体，所提出的失序参数对变量θ表现出非解析性的依赖关系。这一特征对退相干具有鲁棒性，并通过数值模拟和解析推导得到了验证。

Conclusion: 该协议非常适合在近期的量子模拟平台上实施，为实验确认强关联拓扑绝缘体提供了一条直接的途径。

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}θ\hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $θ$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.

Abstract: The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.

Abstract: A large variety of materials can be approximately described by means of spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. Here, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm together with a previously established numerical self-consistent mean-field approximation is used to investigate the magnetic properties of spin ladders coupled in a second dimension. The full ground state phase diagram including spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and fully polarized phases is presented as a function of interladder and intraladder coupling and magnetic field. Measurement of the dependence of magnetization on applied magnetic field is shown to enable location of a material on the phase diagram and determination of the Hamiltonian parameters. These results provide a practical route toward identifying and characterizing magnetic materials composed of coupled spin ladders.

Conclusion: SymPhas 2.0 作为一个灵活、可扩展且高效的框架，能够有效利用基于GPU的高性能计算平台，用于实现相场和反应扩散模型。

Abstract: We present SymPhas 2.0, a major update of the compile-time symbolic algebra simulation framework SymPhas for phase-field and reaction-diffusion models. This release introduces significant expansions and enhancements that enable the definition of a phase-field model directly from the free-energy functional via compile-time evaluated functional differentiation. It also introduces directional derivatives, symbolic summation, tensor-valued expressions, and compile-time derived finite difference stencils of arbitrary order and accuracy. Furthermore, the code has been parallelized for CPUs with MPI, and GPU computing has been added using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). For the latter, symbolic expressions are compiled into optimized CUDA kernels, allowing large-scale simulations to execute entirely on the GPU. For large systems ($32,768^2$ in 2D and $1,024^3$ in 3D with double precision), speedups up to $\sim \!\!1,000 \times$ were obtained compared to the first version of SymPhas using multi-threaded CPU execution on a single system. These developments establish SymPhas 2.0 as a flexible and scalable framework for efficient implementation of phase-field and reaction-diffusion models on GPU-based high-performance computing platforms.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Standard Model vacuum stability exhibits extreme sensitivity to the Higgs quartic coupling: a mere 3\% enhancement represents the critical threshold separating metastability from absolute stability with UV Landau poles. Using three-loop renormalization group equations, we systematically investigate enhancement factors $k = λ_{\rm enhanced}/λ_{\rm SM}$ ranging from $k=1.0$ (Standard Model) to $k=7.2$ (radiative electroweak symmetry breaking prediction). We identify $k_{\rm crit} = 1.03$ as the marginal case where the coupling transitions from negative to positive evolution at high energies. For $k > 1.03$, the theory exhibits absolute vacuum stability and develops UV poles at $Λ_{\rm UV} \sim 10^{16}$--$10^{18}$ GeV, signaling effective field theory breakdown and the onset of strong dynamics. The radiative symmetry breaking scenario with $k \approx 7.2$ falls deep in this regime, naturally connecting the electroweak scale to compositeness or other strong-coupling physics near the GUT scale. Our results reveal that the 125 GeV Higgs mass, lying near the metastability boundary, makes the scalar sector an exceptionally sensitive probe of beyond-Standard-Model physics.

Abstract: We showcase cosmology's ability to constrain long-range forces between dark matter particles. Specifically, we consider a fermionic dark matter interacting via a Yukawa-coupled light scalar, focusing on regimes where the dark forces are stronger than gravitational and yet unconstrained. We show that the dark sector dynamics, both at the background and perturbation levels, is far richer than what can be captured with just the static interparticle Yukawa potential. The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc. In addition, we briefly discuss repulsive dark forces and place cosmological limits that are stricter than in the attractive case.

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of bosonic dark matter candidates that we dub wallions, featuring boundaries in field space. The wallion mass is exponentially suppressed when the separation between boundaries far exceeds their intrinsic width and remains radiatively stable under self-interactions. We study the early-universe evolution of wallions and the associated cosmological signatures. Finally, we show that instanton effects can dynamically generate field-space boundaries and discuss possible experimental probes once the wallion couples to Standard Model fields.

Abstract: We study two-body scattering as an SU(N)-equivariant map acting on tensor-product representation spaces and analyze the entanglement generated by the $S$-matrix. This representation-theoretic perspective separates group structure from dynamics: the decomposition of $R\!\otimes\!R'$ fixes the invariant operator algebra and therefore the qualitative entangling power of the process. For particles in the fundamental representation, $\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{SU}(N)}(N\!\otimes\!N)=\mathrm{Span}\{\mathbb{I},\mathbb{S}\}$, so only the identity and swap directions preserve separability, whereas generic combinations generate entanglement. Adjoint-adjoint scattering involves a larger invariant algebra involving $d$-tensors and is intrinsically entangling. In Yang-Mills theory one can use color-kinematics duality to show that the color kernel lies on a fixed ray of this operator space, yielding a universal maximum of the outgoing entanglement for scattering at right angles, $E_\star^{(2)}=\tfrac{3}{4}$ for $SU(2)$ and $E_\star^{(3)}\simeq0.91$, independent of kinematics. Dimension-six operators preserve this universality, while dimension-eight deformations populate new color sectors and shift $E_\star^{(N)}$, suggesting that entanglement in color space functions as a tomographic probe of effective operators. In helicity space, requiring maximally entangled inputs to scatter into maximally entangled outputs uniquely selects the Yang-Mills quartic coupling and enforces the color Jacobi identity, restating the on-shell Ward constraints as conditions on entanglement preservation. Our results suggest that the information-theoretic viewpoint unifies algebraic, geometric, and dynamical aspects of scattering.

Abstract: We demonstrate that at finite density and sufficiently high temperatures, phase-quenched (PQ) lattice simulations combined with perturbation theory provide a new precision approach to determining the thermodynamics of QCD across a wide arc of the phase diagram where the strong coupling constant $α_s$ remains small. In this regime, nonperturbative pairing effects in the PQ theory are parametrically suppressed, so that the difference between the PQ and full QCD pressures becomes a small perturbative correction. We compute this correction up to and including $O(α_s^{7/2})$ using electrostatic QCD together with a novel numerical method to compute four-loop sum-integrals. This enables the determination of the perturbative QCD pressure with precision beyond the current state of the art while including nonperturbative pure-gluonic contributions from the lattice.

Abstract: The presence of multiple light axions in the infrared is a generic feature of many ultraviolet (UV) scenarios. In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.

Abstract: We study properties of a hypothetical scalar particle, $Θ$, which is a color octet and an electroweak singlet. At hadron colliders, $Θ$ is pair produced through its QCD coupling to gluons, so that its mass determines the cross section. It decays at tree level into $q\bar q$ through dimension-5 operators, and at one loop into gluons. Thus, the main LHC signature of $Θ$ is a pair of dijets of equal invariant mass. The CMS search in this channel shows a $3.6σ$ excess over the QCD background for a dijet mass $M_{jj} \approx 0.95$ TeV, which can be due to $Θ$: its production cross section (65 fb for a real scalar) and the acceptance of the CMS event selection applied to $p p \to ΘΘ\to \! (q \bar q)(q \bar q)$ yield a rate consistent with the excess. Furthermore, the shape of the $dσ/d M_{jj}$ signal is in agreement with the CMS result. Given the data-driven background fit performed by CMS, we find that a complex scalar fits better the data than a real scalar. Besides the pair of dijets, testable LHC signals include a trijet-dijet topology, a $t\bar t$ pair plus a dijet resonance, as well as final states involving a Higgs, $W$ or $Z$ boson plus jets.

Abstract: Spin asymmetries in collisions of spin-polarized hadrons probe polarized parton distributions, which encode the spin structure of the colliding hadrons. To perform precision physics studies with spin asymmetries, higher order QCD corrections to the underlying polarized cross sections are required. Their numerical implementation relies on the use of an infrared subtraction scheme, which extracts the infrared singular pieces from the real and virtual subprocesses. We derive the universal behaviour of longitudinally polarized real radiation matrix elements in their infrared-singular limits up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, thereby enabling the construction of infrared subtraction schemes for generic polarized cross sections at NNLO.

Abstract: CP violation, which involves breaking the combined charge-conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetries, is essential for understanding the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. It is a key feature of the Standard Model, originating from complex phases in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix. Despite the successes of the SM, the amount of CP violation it predicts is not enough to explain baryogenesis, prompting searches for new sources of CP violation in other areas of particle physics. This article offers a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical foundations of C, P, and T symmetries and their combinations. It also emphasizes the importance of CP violation in modern particle physics and how it can be used to explore New Physics.

Abstract: Screened scalars are ubiquitous in many dark-sector models. They give rise to non-trivial fifth forces whilst evading experimental constraints through density-dependent screening mechanisms. We propose equipping a 10\,m-scale long-baseline atom interferometer with an annular planar source mass inside the vacuum chamber to search for such screened fifth forces. Two key challenges arise: distinguishing the static fifth force from backgrounds, and isolating it from the plate's Newtonian gravity. We introduce the `$Q$-flip protocol', which alternates between interferometry sequences to induce controllable time-dependence, aiding signal extraction and de-trending of transient noise. We further develop an \emph{in situ} calibration procedure to characterise the plate's Newtonian gravity and reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. We show that our proposal could test theoretically motivated parameter space, advancing existing bounds in chameleon and symmetron screened scalar models by $1$ to $1.5$ orders of magnitude. Our proposal is directly applicable to forthcoming experiments, such as AION-10 or VLBAI, and is readily extensible to broader theoretical models and longer baselines.

Abstract: We discuss the HL-LHC sensitivity to probe new invisible particles including scalars and fermions using semi-visible Higgs decays. The kinematics of these decays allow new particle masses below $m\lesssim 50$ GeV. We carry out our analysis within the framework of a dark-SMEFT effective theory with operators up to dimension six and a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the new particles are odd and the SM particles are even. We compare our results to those obtained from considering the invisible $Z$-width, as well as simple perturbative unitarity arguments. Finally, we outline kinematic strategies at the LHC to distinguish different operator structures of the postulated invisible particles.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present work on quantifying the minimum requirements for beam polarization precision at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories. We find that, under the assumption of a high electron beam polarization ($P_-$) that the positron polarization ($P_+$) is of key importance but for reasons both known and newly discovered. We have discovered that improved positron polarization leads to a less strict requirement on the beam polarization precision for measurements that scale only with the effective polarization, $P_\mathrm{eff}$. Conversely, measurements that scale with the product of beam polarizations, $P_-P_+$, such as those that contain the $eeZ$ or $eeγ$ vertex, have their polarization precision demands get more strict as positron polarization increases. We check the polarization precision demands for $10^{-3}$ on the Higgsstrahlung cross-section ($σ_{ZH}$) at 250~GeV, $10^{-4}$ on the electron left-right asymmetry ($A_{\rm e}$) at the Z pole, and $10^{-4}$ on the di-photon cross-section ($σ_{γγ}$) from the Z pole to 3~TeV. We find that, for measurements away from the Z pole, the goals can plausibly be attained if one can achieve precision on beam polarization better than $0.1\%$. For measurements of $A_{\rm e}$ at $10^{-4}$, colliders must do better than $0.02\%$ on beam polarization precision, or determine ways to upgrade their beam polarization values towards unity, where the requirements decrease to better than $0.15\%$.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new method to detect the composition of the $X(3872)$ state. Based on a widely accepted interpretation that $X(3872)$ is a weakly bound $S$-wave molecule of the $D^{*0} \bar{D}^{0}$ (neutral) and $D^{*+} D^{-}$ (charged) configurations, the process $X(3872) \to \bar{D}^{*0} D^0$ is described by one-loop triangle diagrams with the corresponding components as intermediate particles, and with the parameters constrained by the experimental branching ratio. Unlike the mild behavior of the neutral component, the charged component manifests itself as a distinct structure near the $D^{*+} D^{-}$ threshold at $3.880$ GeV, in the $M_{\bar{D}^{*0} D^0}$ invariant mass distribution of the spin density matrix element $ρ^{D^*}_{00}$. Hence the line shape of $ρ^{D^*}_{00}$ near this structure depends sensitively on the proportions of the two configurations. We propose high-precision measurements of this matrix element by future BESIII and Belle experiments to elucidate how a molecular $X(3872)$ state is composed.

Abstract: We investigate the pseudoscalar ($η_t$) and vector ($ψ_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($Ω_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5σ$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium align with the CMS prediction within the corresponding uncertainty range. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a resonant behavior in axion-trapped misalignment models featuring finite-temperature potential barriers. As the temperature decreases and the field is released from its trapped configuration, inhomogeneities are exponentially amplified through an instability in their equation of motion, leading to the fragmentation of the axion field. We show that this process constitutes a novel source of gravitational waves (GWs), analogous to those generated in zero-temperature axion fragmentation, but with distinct characteristics. We quantify the resulting GW spectrum, identifying the peak frequency and amplitude associated with the inhomogeneous axion dynamics. Our results indicate that the GW signal can be enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard fragmentation scenario, while exhibiting a markedly different spectral shape. The parameter space featuring both strong GW signals and reproducing the correct dark matter abundance is, however, limited.

Abstract: We study the prospects of the proposed $μ$TRISTAN experiment, running in the energy asymmetric $μ^+ e^-$ mode, in probing long lived particles (LLPs) arising from the decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson. We focus on the proposed runs with $\{E_{μ^+}, E_{e^-}\} = \{1\,{\rm TeV},\,30\,{\rm GeV}\}$ and $\{E_{μ^+}, E_{e^-}\} = \{3\,{\rm TeV},\,50\,{\rm GeV}\}$ and we show that, owing to the boosted nature of the produced events, a far detector placed along the beam line can collect a large fraction of the LLP flux. This allows one to set bounds on the exotic Higgs branching ratio which, for specific $φ$ decay modes, can surpass those expected at the end of the High Luminosity LHC in the regime of large LLPs proper decay lengths. On the other hand, we find that the proposed strategy will not be able to further extend the limits that might be set by proposed LHC far detectors such as CODEX-b, ANUBIS and MATHUSLA.

Abstract: The one-pion exchange interaction between the kaon and the vector antikaon is investigated by solving the Schrödinger equation in the S-wave approximation. In addition to the particle $f_1(1285)$, another bound state of $K \bar{K}^*$ is obtained, which is approximately 9 MeV below the threshold of $K \bar{K}^*$ and labeled $f_1(1378)$ for convenience in this manuscript. Under the outgoing wave condition, two resonance states of $K \bar{K}^*$ are produced with different coupling constants fixed with the binding energies of $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1378)$, respectively. Both of the resonance states are located in the vicinity of 1400 MeV, and thus it is reasonable to assume that these two resonance states correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of the Particle Data Group simultaneously. This method is extended to study the $D \bar{D}^*$ system analogously. When the particle $χ_{c1}(3872)$ is treated as a bound state of $D \bar{D}^*$, the particles $T_{c\bar{c}1}(3900)$, $T_{c \bar{c}}(4020)$ and $X(3940)$ can be obtained as solutions of the Schrödinger equation under the outgoing wave condition, which implies the spin and parity of these particles are all $J^P=1^+$.

Motivation: 在高能物理中，存在多种用于分析粒子自旋的方法，例如自旋断层扫描、纠缠衰变相关性分析等。这篇论文的动机是为这些看似不同的方法提供一个统一的理论基础，并探索利用高能物理过程来检验量子力学基本原理（如相干性与干涉）的新途径。

Method: 研究人员将高能粒子衰变的运动学特征（如衰变产物的角分布）建模为连续的“指针变量”。这些变量的重叠分布仅部分地揭示了母粒子自旋态的信息，从而构成了一种信息上的弱测量。通过对大量衰变事件的指针变量进行系综平均，可以得到量子力学中的“弱值”，进而将实际的对撞机数据分析与阿哈罗诺夫-瓦伊德曼（Aharonov-Vaidman）的测量理论联系起来。

Result: 该研究成功证明，高能环境下的相对论性粒子衰变过程，其本质就是对母粒子自旋的一种信息弱测量。基于这一发现，研究建立了一个统一的理论框架，该框架能够整合包括自旋断层扫描、纠缠衰变相关性以及自旋相关算法在内的多种现有自旋分析技术。

Conclusion: 该研究的结论是，将高能粒子衰变视为一种量子弱测量，为理解和分析粒子自旋提供了一个统一且有效的理论框架。这一新视角不仅整合了现有方法，还为利用高能物理实验探索量子相干性与干涉等基本量子现象开辟了新的道路。

Abstract: High-energy particle decays naturally realise informationally weak measurements of quantum spin. Decay kinematics act as continuous pointer variables whose overlapping angular distributions encode partial, non-projective information about the parent spin state. Ensemble averages of these pointers yield weak values, linking collider spin-density reconstruction to Aharonov-Vaidman measurement theory. This framework unifies spin tomography, entangled-decay correlations, and spin-correlation algorithms, showing that relativistic decays realise informationally weak measurements of spin and suggesting new ways to probe coherence and interference in high-energy processes.

Abstract: We explore the cosmological dynamics of a supercooled first-order phase transition in the classically conformal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model, where radiative symmetry breaking simultaneously generates the right-handed neutrino (RHN) masses, and a strong stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations.

It was developed in the context of the "Strong-Field QED Workshop 2024" at DESY, aimed at supporting early-career researchers entering the field from the experimental side. Rather than providing a comprehensive theoretical review, the document focuses on the core ideas, terminology, and challenges in SFQED that are most relevant to experimental design and interpretation. Our goal is to offer a first point of contact with the subject, bridging the gap between foundational theory and hands-on experimental work, and complementing more formal literature in the field.

Abstract: We discuss the $(L,n)$-classification of excited light non-strange mesons, where $L$ and $n$ are orbital and radial quantum numbers. The selection of true non-strange quark-antiquark excited states and assigning to them definite $L$ and $n$ is a notoriously confusing problem. Three guiding principles for selection of correct observed states are formulated. They are applied for construction of a new $(L,n)$-classification. This classification is consistent both with the approximate Regge form of the spectrum and with the hydrogen-like degeneracy, i.e., the dependence of mass on the sum $L+n$.

We propose that this substructure arises directly from di-pion correlations. Using a chiral unitary approach, we successfully reproduce the observed anomaly, thereby providing strong evidence of di-pion correlation in heavy quarkonium decays. This approach also allows us to predict the corresponding di-pion correlation function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大量新的高精度实验数据为更新和改进双体粲介子衰变 ($D 	o PV$) 的理论分析提供了契机。

Method: 采用“因子分解辅助拓扑振幅”（FAT）方法。该方法将味SU(3)对称性破缺效应納入拓扑振幅中，并通过对实验数据的全局拟合来确定一组最少的普适参数，用以描述拓扑图中的非因子化贡献。

Result: 成功量化了“因子分解”T图的非因子化贡献；以更高的精度更新了C、E、A图的参数，并发现强相互作用相位与早期分析显著不同；预测的分支比与当前数据吻合良好，某些衰变模式下的直接CP不对称性预测值达到了$10^{-3}$量级。

Conclusion: 更新后的FAT方法能够更准确地预测粲介子的衰变行为。研究预测了若干具有较大CP不对称性的衰变模式，这些模式有望在未来的LHCb、BESIII和Belle II等高精度实验中被观测到，同时也为寻找尚未发现的衰变模式提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Motivated by extensive new high-precision experimental data, we present an updated analysis of the two-body charm decays $D \to PV$ (with $P =π,K, η^{(\prime)}$ and
  $V =ρ, K^*, ω, φ$) within the
  factorization-assisted topological-amplitude (FAT) approach. In the framework, flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking effect is incorporated into the topological amplitudes, allowing the nonfactorizable contributions from topological diagrams to be expressed as a minimal set of universal parameters determined through a global fit to experimental data. Thanks to the sufficient data with high precision, we are now able to quantify the nonfactorizable contribution of so-called ``factorization" $T$ diagram, which is essential for explaining the observed branching ratios. The parameters for the $C$, $E$, and $A$ diagrams are also updated with significant improved precision, and notably, the resulting strong phases differ substantially from those in the earlier FAT analysis. We find that the $C$ topological amplitude features substantial nonfactorizable effects in the charm sector. These refined parameters enable predictions of significantly improved accuracy, yielding branching ratios in good agreement with current data and the latest results in topological diagram approach, and the predicted direct $\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries differ distinctly form previous FAT results due to updated strong phases. In several modes, the $\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries are predicted to reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, thereby making them promising observables for future high-precision experiments at LHCb, BESIII and Belle II. Predictions for unobserved decay modes, especially those with branching fractions of order $10^{-4}\sim10^{-3}$, are also provided for forthcoming experimental tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的对称性破缺一级相变中，过渡辐射产生的摩擦压力会阻碍气泡壁的失控加速。作者旨在探究在对称性恢复的相变中，这个效应会有何不同，以及其对引力波和新物理等现象可能产生的影响。

Method: 作者计算了在对称性恢复相变中，当热等离子体中的粒子穿过气泡壁时，因过渡辐射（发射具有相位依赖质量的规范玻色子）而产生的压力。

Result: 计算结果显示，在对称性恢复相变中，该过程产生的压力可以是负的，形成一个“负摩擦”区域。尽管在极高洛伦兹因子下，该效应会趋同于标准情况，但这个负摩擦机制使得气泡壁的最终速度（洛伦兹因子）可以比对称性破缺情况高出一个数量级以上。

Conclusion: 对称性恢复相变可以存在一个中间的负摩擦阶段，这使得气泡壁能够达到比传统对称性破缺相变更高的末端速度。这一发现对于引力波和超出标准模型的新物理等现象学应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: In standard (symmetry-breaking) first-order phase transitions, the frictional pressure on expanding bubble walls can be dominated by transition radiation -- the emission of a gauge boson with phase-dependent masses as particles present in the thermal plasma pass through bubble walls. This process is enhanced in the soft limit, and is known to produce a significant frictional effect that is proportional to the Lorentz factor $γ$ of the bubble wall, thereby prohibiting runaway behavior. We calculate the analogous pressure for phase transitions with symmetry restoration. In such transitions, we show that the pressure due to this process can be $\textit{negative}$, producing the opposite effect. However, when the Lorentz factor of the wall gets very large, the result approaches the same scaling as the standard scenarios. Therefore, phase transitions with symmetry restoration can feature an intermediate negative friction regime even in the presence of significant interactions with the plasma, and the bubble wall terminal Lorentz factor can be significantly larger (by more than an order of magnitude) than in the corresponding symmetry-breaking scenarios. This can carry important implications for various phenomenological applications, from gravitational waves to physics beyond-the-Standard-Model.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenological implications of the bosons associated with the $SU(2)_F$ subgroup in a simple and realistic $U(2)_F$ flavor model. While the PNGB of the $U(1)_F$ factor behaves as a standard QCD axion (an axiflavon) with suppressed flavor-violating couplings, the three degrees of freedom from $SU(2)_F$ have not been studied before. This work focuses on these states, considering both the case where $SU(2)_F$ is a global symmetry, yielding pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGBs), and the case where it is a gauge symmetry with a potentially small coupling, yielding a triplet of (possibly) light gauge bosons. In both scenarios, these new bosons naturally feature unsuppressed flavor-violating couplings to Standard Model fermions in the mass basis. We derive the resulting predictions for flavor-changing neutral currents and lepton flavor violation, including exotic decays of mesons and leptons. Our analysis shows that processes like $K \to πX$ and $μ\to e X$ place the most stringent constraints, probing the flavor symmetry breaking scale $v_φ$ up to $10^{11}-10^{12}$ GeV for light bosons, while heavier states are tested in $B$ and $τ$ decays, as well as by $K-\bar K$ mixing and $μ\to e γ$. We demonstrate that low-energy flavor experiments provide a powerful probe of this framework, capable of testing ultra-high symmetry breaking scales that surpass the limits set by astrophysical observations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于研究“味”暗物质模型的综合分析框架和公开工具。该框架整合了各种实验限制，并通过案例分析表明，对于亲轻子模型，味物理过程是主要限制；而对于亲夸克模型，直接探测实验的限制更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了对“味”暗物质（Flavored Dark Matter）模型进行全面且一致的研究，需要一个能整合暗物质遗迹密度、直接/间接探测、对撞机实验以及味物理等多方面限制的统一框架。

Method: 作者构建了一个综合分析框架。该框架能够计算暗物质遗迹密度，并结合直接/间接探测、对撞机（如LHC）的限制。特别地，它还利用标准模型有效场论（SMEFT）匹配和重整化群演化（RGE）技术，对味物理观测量进行全局分析。作者将此框架应用于两种具体的马约拉纳（Majorana）暗物质场景进行验证：一种与带电轻子耦合，另一种与下型夸克耦合。

Result: 在与轻子耦合的情况下，主要的限制来自于味破缺过程（如 μ→eγ 衰变），但LHC的搜索结果仍允许相当大的参数空间。在与夸克耦合的情况下，暗物质直接探测实验和介子混合现象对模型的限制非常强，这倾向于支持一种具有层级结构的味耦合模式。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个强大的、用于研究“味”暗物质的综合性框架，并将其开源。通过对两个典型模型的分析，论文证明了该框架的有效性，并揭示了不同类型实验（如味物理、对撞机和暗物质直接探测）在限制模型参数空间时的互补性。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for the study of flavored dark matter models, combining relic density calculations with direct and indirect detection limits, collider constraints, and a global analysis of flavor observables based on SMEFT matching and renormalization-group evolution. The framework applies to scalar or fermionic dark matter, including both self-conjugate and non-self-conjugate cases. As a proof of principle, we analyze two scenarios with Majorana dark matter coupling to right-handed charged leptons and to right-handed down-type quarks, assuming a thermal freeze-out. In the leptophilic case, flavor-violating decays such as $μ\to e γ$ dominate the constraints, while LHC searches still leave sizable parameter space. For quark couplings, direct detection bounds and meson mixing severely restrict the allowed couplings, favoring hierarchical flavor structures. The toolchain presented in this paper is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/lena-ra/Flavored-Dark-Matter).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Verne2的快速半解析方法，用于计算强相互作用暗物质穿过地球时的散射效应，该方法在保证一定准确度的同时，将计算效率提升了数万倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过蒙特卡洛方法计算强相互作用暗物质在地球中的散射效应，其计算成本极高，这阻碍了对暗物质参数空间的系统性探索。因此，需要一种更快速的计算方法来模拟由地球屏蔽效应产生的信号日常调制现象。

Method: 作者开发了一种半解析形式主义（及相应代码Verne2），专用于计算通过暗光子媒介相互作用的MeV质量级暗物质。该方法假设暗物质沿直线传播，在散射后沿原路径反射，从而同时考虑了地球对暗物质流的衰减和反射效应。

Result: 与完整的蒙特卡洛模拟结果相比，该半解析方法（Verne2）的计算结果准确度在10-30%以内，同时将计算成本降低了约10^4倍。

Conclusion: Verne2方法在保证足够准确度的前提下，极大地提升了计算效率，使其非常适合用于对暗物质日常调制信号进行建模分析，从而能够加速对强相互作用暗物质的搜索。

Abstract: While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新机制，即旋转的轴子（axion）与暗磁单极子相互作用，这种相互作用不仅耗散了轴子的能量，解释了暗物质的丰度，同时还产生了宇宙中的重子不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在建立一个统一的框架，用以解释暗物质的构成，以及观测到的重子不对称性的起源，并说明为何轴子的丰度能被耗散至观测到的暗物质水平。

Method: 作者引入了一种新机制，其中旋转轴子的动能通过与暗磁单极子的相互作用而耗散。在轴子场中，磁单极子获得质量并在不同的量子化能级之间跃迁，从而消耗轴子的动能，同时通过“轴子生成”（axiogenesis）过程产生重子不对称。

Result: 研究预测，为了解释观测到的暗物质和重子密度，轴子衰变常数（axion decay constant）需要低于10^9 GeV。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个统一的框架，其中QCD轴子和暗磁单极子可以同时解释暗物质密度和通过旋转轴子的能量耗散过程产生观测到的重子不对称性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism where the kinetic energy of a rotating axion can be dissipated by the interactions with dark magnetic monopoles. This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance. We predict that the axion decay constant should be below $10^9$ GeV to explain the observed dark matter and baryon densities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种格林函数方法，用于在驱动的超导-半导体混合系统中，通过正确处理能级展宽效应，来预测其弗洛凯（Floquet）拓扑相。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在外部驱动的超导-半导体混合系统中，通常将超导体视为简单的库珀对“蓄水池”的近似方法会失效，因为它会导致能级展宽。现有工作虽指出了这个问题，但仍缺乏一种有效方法来构建这类系统的弗洛凯拓扑不变量。

Method: 论文提出了一种格林函数方法。首先，通过半导体自能的厄米（hermitian）部分获得准能谱；然后，将自能的反厄米（anti-hermitian）部分投影到准能谱的本征矢量上，以读出能级展宽。作者以一个具体的Rashba纳米线系统为例验证了该方法。

Result: 使用该方法，作者成功计算出了一个Rashba纳米线模型系统的弗洛凯（Floquet）能带结构、相应的能级展宽和拓扑不变量。

Conclusion: 该研究证实，在驱动系统中，正确处理自能（self-energy）是必要的。其分析结果表明，能级展宽效应会阻碍对弗洛凯拓扑相的观测，尤其是那些含有马约拉纳π模（Majorana π modes）的拓扑相。

Abstract: We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes.

Abstract: The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.

Abstract: Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-γ}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($ρ\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($σ(ω) \sim ω^{γ-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.

Motivation: 为了在非晶等无长程平移对称性的系统中有效诊断拓扑相，本文旨在探究局域量子几何标记的非局域性。

Method: 将量子几何标记的非局域性作为关联函数进行分析，研究其在拓扑相变附近的急剧变化，并为每次相变绘制独特的实空间模式。

Result: 研究发现，这些非局域标记表现得像关联函数，在拓扑相变点附近会发生剧烈变化。重要的是，即使在同一对称类别（Altland-Zirnbauer class）内，不同的拓扑相变也会产生性质完全不同的空间特征，从而能够更精细地探测拓扑稳定性。

Conclusion: 非局域量子几何标记为理解和预测拓扑相变的稳定性提供了一种更高效、更通用的工具。

Abstract: Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了“接触门控”效应对二维晶体管性能的影响，发现该效应能显著提升器件性能，尤其是在短沟道器件中，并指出这是评估二维晶体管性能时一个被低估的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二维场效应晶体管（2D FETs）的性能受其几何结构影响，尤其是一种称为“接触门控”（contact gating）的现象，即栅极电势会调制电极下方的半导体。尽管该现象普遍存在，但其具体影响尚未被准确定量和充分认识。

Method: 研究人员采用了一种具有独立可控顶栅和背栅的对称双栅结构，以单层二硫化钼（MoS2）为沟道材料。这种对称结构使他们能够分离并量化接触门控效应，并为此定义了一个“接触门控因子”。

Result: 实验发现，接触门控效应在长沟道器件中使导通状态性能提升了2倍。在更小的尺寸（50纳米沟道）下，该效应的影响更为显著，使导通性能提升了5倍，并将传输长度减少了70%。

Conclusion: 接触门控是决定二维晶体管性能的一个关键且以往被低估的因素。许多报道中性能创纪录的二维晶体管都采用了会产生接触门控的背栅结构，因此该研究结果对于理解和设计高性能二维器件至关重要。

Abstract: The performance and scalability of two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) are strongly influenced by geometry-defined electrostatics. In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape.

Abstract: Recent development in nanotechnology has enabled us to investigate the dynamic properties of van der Waals materials on a piezoelectric substrate. Here we report on the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW) in NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). Clear peaks in the differential resistance were observed at the resonant frequency of the SAW device. These peaks known as Shapiro steps are typically observed by applying an rf current to NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires. We found that the Shapiro steps induced by SAWs show several distinct features from the ones induced by an rf current. Our detailed study revealed that a strain induced by SAWs plays a significant role in the Shapiro steps. The result clearly demonstrates the importance of the strain in CDW materials and paves the way for strain-induced device applications.

Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), when exposed to a suitably applied Zeeman field, exhibit one-dimensional helical channels with a spin orientation locked to the propagation direction within the magnetic energy gap. Here, by adopting a scattering-matrix approach applied to a tight-binding model of the NW, we demonstrate that the thermoelectric (TE) properties can be widely controlled by tuning the misalignment angle $φ$ between the spin-orbit directions of two NW segments. In particular, when the RSOC vectors are antiparallel (Dirac paradox configuration) we predict a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, and a strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the $ZT$ figure of merit. We also show that the Zeeman gap determines the optimal energy window for doping and temperatures. These results suggest that controlling the spin-orbit field direction, which can be achieved with suitably applied wrap gates, is a promising alternative for tuning and optimizing the TE response in quantum-coherent semiconducting NW devices.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) moiré superlattices have provided a powerful knob to engineer a plethora of new quantum states. However, extending such moiré engineering to one-dimensional (1D) vdW systems has remained challenging. Here we report the moiré-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moiré superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems. Our work establishes a new and definite moiré engineering route for 1D vdW materials and opens an exciting avenue for exploring interaction-induced quantum phases in 1D.

Abstract: We study the magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electronic system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling in which the system is described by a pair of chiral spin texture in each spin branch, and the chirality is opposite in two spin branches. We obtain the Landau levels analytically and find that intra-spin and/or inter-spin Landau level crossing occurs. We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level. However, the Landau level crossing gives rise to the double jump in the Hall conductivity if the Fermi level is placed precisely at the crossing point.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Materials are commonly distinguished by their magnetic response into diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and magnetically ordered (ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic) phases. Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or Néel temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/Néel temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the Néel temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields. We observe coherently excited low-energy paramagnon-polaritons up to $\mathbf{23\,\mathrm{GHz}}$ , propagating over $\mathbf{8\,\mathrm{mm}}$ at supersonic group velocities exceeding $\mathbf{100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}}$. Using free radicals as magnon carriers integrates organic materials with spintronics and opens the way to organic electronics, dense information storage, and quantum technologies.

Abstract: The measurements of Hanle and polarization recovery effects for localized charge carriers are the basic tools for determining parameters of the spin dynamics, such as strength of the hyperfine interaction, for example, in quantum dots. We describe the dependence of the spin polarization of localized electrons on transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields taking into account the interplay between electron hopping and measurement back action. We show that these two have a qualitatively similar effect in the Faraday geometry, but compete in the Voigt geometry. This allows one to describe a broad range of the experimental results and study the fundamental effects of quantum measurements.

Abstract: The excitation and detection of propagating spin waves with lithographed nanoantennas underpin both classical magnonic circuits and emerging quantum technologies. Here, we establish a framework for all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (AEPSWS) that links realistic electromagnetic drive fields to micromagnetic dynamics. Using finite-element (FE) simulations, we compute the full vector near-field of electrical impedance-matched, tapered coplanar and stripline antennas and import this distribution into finite-difference (FD) micromagnetic solvers. This approach captures the antenna-limited wave-vector spectrum and the component-selective driving fields (perpendicular to the static magnetisation) that simplified uniform-field models cannot. From this coupling, we derive how realistic current return paths and tapering shapes, k-weighting functions, for Damon-Eshbach surface spin waves in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) films are, for millimetre-scale matched CPWs and linear tapers down to nanometre-scale antennas. Validation against experimental AEPSWS on a $48\,nm$ YIG film shows quantitative agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peak positions, establishing that the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter. These results provide actionable design rules for on-chip magnonic transducers, with immediate relevance for low-power operation regimes and prospective applications in quantum magnonics.

Abstract: Point defects or impurities can give rise to sharp local modifications in the structure and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, serving as an intriguing atomic-level solid-state model for both fundamental and application research. In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics.

Abstract: The performance and reliability of spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) can be compromised by anomalous switching behavior, especially during high-speed operations. One such anomaly, known as the "ballooning effect" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM.

Abstract: Topologically secure spin configurations, such as skyrmions and bimerons, offer a compelling alternative to conventional magnetic domains, potentially enabling high-density, low-power spintronic devices. These pseudo-particles, characterized by their swirling spin textures and nontrivial topological charges, are prevalent and notably influence their electronic, magnetic, and mechanical traits. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the interaction between a screw dislocation within a distorted magnetic lattice, exploring possible coupling mechanisms and establishing a promising link between two disparate topics in materials science: topological magnetism and topological elasticity. We first provide a classical analysis of skyrmion motion that reveals the dislocations as shallow traps on the magnetic texture. Afterwards, we provide an analysis of the quantized motion of the skyrmion and identify its quantum states. We conclude by illustrating how the ideas in our paper can be implemented in simple yet compelling devices based on the shallow traps from an array of dislocations acting as frets in a race-track, controlling the motion with a low current activation mechanism.

Abstract: Crystalline symmetries determine the linear and nonlinear response of materials to external stimuli such as mechanical pressure and electromagnetic fields, governing phenomena such as piezoelectricity, optical activity, and multiple wave mixing with wide ranging technological applications. Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.
