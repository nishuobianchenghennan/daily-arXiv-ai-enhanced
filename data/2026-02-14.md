Motivation: 电子电偶极矩（EDM）的实验灵敏度已大幅提高，未来有潜力探测到在三循环级别才出现的新物理效应。先前的研究表明，通过电弱-温伯格算符的贡献是可探测的，但该贡献缺少对数增强。因此，有必要直接计算在相同三循环阶次下由CP奇电子偶极算符产生的另一部分贡献，以获得完整的图像。

Method: 研究人员通过直接进行完整的三循环（three-loop）计算，来确定由 SU(2)_L 多重态的CP破坏性汤川相互作用所引起的电子电偶极矩。

Result: 完整的三循环计算结果表明，总贡献比仅考虑电弱-温伯格算符（electroweak-Weinberg operator）的贡献大了三倍。

Conclusion: 这表明，除了电弱-温伯格算符外，电子的CP奇偶极算符也做出了重要贡献。因此，在这类新物理模型中，电子电偶极矩的总效应比先前预期的要大，这增加了其在未来实验中被探测到的可能性。

Abstract: Experimental sensitivity to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron has improved remarkably in recent years. Consequently, future prospects could probe new physics whose contribution to the electron EDM first arises at three-loop order. Additional SU(2)$_L$ multiplets with CP-violating Yukawa interactions, which contribute to the electron EDM at three-loop level, is one such testable new physics scenario. In this scenario, the electron EDM is radiatively induced from two contributions: the CP-odd trilinear $W$-boson coupling, called the electroweak-Weinberg operator, and the CP-odd dipole operator of electron. The former and the latter operators are generated at two-loop and three-loop levels, respectively, after integrating out the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. Within the same models, according to an analysis based on the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we previously found that the contribution to the electron EDM from the electroweak-Weinberg operator can be probed in future experiments. However, the one-loop matching condition between the electron EDM and the electroweak-Weinberg operator does not receive a large logarithmic enhancement because the associated anomalous dimension is zero. The CP-odd dipole operator of the electron would contribute to the electron EDM at the same three-loop order as the contribution through the electroweak-Weinberg operator. In this paper, we directly calculate the electron EDM induced by the CP-violating Yukawa interactions of the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets at full three-loop level. A central result is that the full three-loop calculation is a factor of three larger than that of the electroweak-Weinberg operator alone.
