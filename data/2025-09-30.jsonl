The core\neconomic problem, the optimization of consumption and savings under\nidiosyncratic uncertainty, is formulated as a coupled system of partial\ndifferential equations: a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the\nagent's optimal policy and a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation for the\nstationary wealth distribution. SIMPOL addresses this system using Howard's\npolicy iteration with an *upwind* finite difference scheme that guarantees\nstability. A distinctive contribution is a novel consumption policy\npost-processing module that imposes regularity through smoothing and a\nprojection onto an economically plausible slope band, improving convergence and\nmodel behavior. The robustness and accuracy of SIMPOL are validated through a\nset of integrated diagnostics, including verification of contraction in the\nWasserstein-2 metric and comparison with the analytical solution of the Merton\nmodel in the no-volatility case. The framework is shown to be not only\ncomputationally efficient but also to produce solutions consistent with\neconomic and mathematical theory, offering a reliable tool for research in\nquantitative macroeconomics."}

Electrical resistivity\nreveals a distinct change in the slope below 25 K, deviating from the expected\nBloch-Gr\\\"uneisen behavior. This anomaly is attributed towards a structural\nchange as at 22 K single crystal X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation\nuncovers weak superlattice reflections that leads to a doubling of $\\textbf{a}$\nand $\\textbf{c}$, resulting in a 4-fold superstructure. The symmetry of the\nlattice reduces from tetragonal to acentric monoclinic but without any\ndiscernible monoclinic distortion down to 10 K. This structural transition is\naccompanied by a twofold symmetry in angular magnetoresistance, contrasting the\nfourfold symmetry observed at higher temperatures. First-principles\ncalculations show no phonon softening but reveal enhanced electronic\nsusceptibility, suggesting an electronic instability. Polarization-dependent\nARPES measurements further identify a strong orbital anisotropy dominated by\nthe in-plane Co-$d_{xy}$ states. Collectively, our results point to an\nelectronic instability driven structural distortion in CoSn$_2$, offering a\nrare platform to study symmetry breaking in a non-magnetic metallic system."}

Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the\nMeissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a\nsuperconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner\nscreening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI\nsurface.

Our\nstudy employs mass splitting induced by spin-dependent interactions within the\nj-j coupling scheme. Our predicted masses align well with the experimental\nmeasurements for the well-established $D$ and $D_s$ states. However, anomalous\nresonances such as $D_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ do not align with\nconventional meson states within our theoretical framework. Based on our\nreliable mass predictions for low-lying states, we propose spectroscopic\nassignments for several recently observed high-mass resonances:\n$D_2(2740)^{0}$, $D^*_3(2750)$, $D_0(2550)^{0}$, $D^*_1(2600)^{0}$,\n$D_1^*(2760)^0$, $D^*_J(3000)$, $D_J(3000)$, $D^*_2(3000)$,\n$D^*_{s1}(2860)^{\\pm}$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)^{\\pm}$.Additionally, the resonance\n$D_{sJ}(3040)^+$ is identified as a $2P$ excitation with spin-parity quantum\nnumbers $J^P = 1^+$. Extending our model, we also calculate the mass spectra of\ndoubly charmed $\\Xi_{cc}$ and $\\Omega_{cc}$ baryons within the\nheavy-diquark-light-quark picture. These theoretical predictions provide\ncrucial guidance for ongoing and future experimental searches for higher radial\nand orbital excitations in the charmed meson and doubly charmed baryon sectors."}

Controlled variation of electron-beam irradiation\ntime tunes the defect density, as reflected by the evolution of defect-mediated\nphotoluminescence characteristics. The optically active defect emission\nappearing at approx. 200-300meV below the A exciton at 85K exhibits a\nsystematic increase in intensity with prolonged exposure and saturates at\nhigher laser excitation power. Circular polarization-resolved photoluminescence\nspectroscopy reveals strong suppression of valley polarization of the A exciton\nafter irradiation. Complementary x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies\nenhanced Mo-O bonding signatures in MoS2 following irradiation. Kelvin probe\nforce microscopy indicates the transition to p-type doping behaviour. A\ndetailed temperature and power-dependent photoluminescence measurements further\nelucidate the optical behaviour of these defect states.

It is usually assumed that topological\ndefects are produced if the temperature becomes sufficiently high, but in\nreality their formation depends on the post-inflationary dynamics of a\nsymmetry-breaking scalar. We analyze the dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar\nfield in the early universe within models that provide an effective negative\nmass term at the origin, and show that the symmetry can remain broken so that\ntopological defects are never formed. In particular, we demonstrate that\nnonthermally produced particles (such as the Standard Model Higgs) during\npreheating can generate such an effective negative mass term, allowing the\nscalar field to follow a time-dependent minimum even in renormalizable models\nwith a quartic coupling.

A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling\nto ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses\na significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles\nthrough processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the\nproduction of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction\nwith the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the\nfield-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for\nmassless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal\npolarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations\nof motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us\nto address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production,\nincluding backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we\napply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass\nterms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The\npresent study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal\npolarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic\ninflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to\nenhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic\ncoupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases,\nthe primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse\npolarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling\nfunction, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and\nrapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime."}
