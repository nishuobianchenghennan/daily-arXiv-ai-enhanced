However, identifying these optimal parameters\nthrough topology optimization (TO) across a large parametric space requires\nextensive computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel deep learning framework for metamaterial topology optimization using an\nenhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) approach. Generating low-resolution\ntopologies significantly reduces computational cost compared to high-resolution\ndesigns. Therefore, an EDSR network is trained to learn the mapping between\nlow- and high-resolution metamaterial topologies. The training dataset is\ngenerated using solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP)-based TO. We\ndemonstrate the proposed approach for the design of mechanical metamaterials\ntargeting objectives such as maximization of bulk modulus, shear modulus, and\nelastic modulus, and minimization of Poisson's ratio. Quantitative assessments\n-including (i) pixel value error, (ii) objective function error, (iii)\nintersection over union, and (iv) volume fraction error -validate the accuracy\nof the EDSR-based TO. Our framework predicts high-resolution topologies of size\n$192 \\times 192$ from optimized low-resolution topologies of size $48 \\times\n48$. Once trained, the proposed network predicts these high-resolution\ntopologies with only $5-7\\%$ of the computational cost required by conventional\nSIMP-based TO at the same resolution. Moreover, by adding upscale blocks, the\nframework can generate smoother, higher-resolution topologies suitable for 3D\nprinting.

We provide the first comprehensive update\nto the long-distance corrections in almost forty years and comment on the\nimpact of our findings for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. We find that shifts in\nthe long-distance corrections are $2.5\\times$ larger than past estimates of\ntheir uncertainty, $1.5\\times$ larger than the statistical uncertainty from the\ncombined fit of superallowed decays, and about $1/2$ the size of estimated\nsystematic error, which stems dominantly from nuclear structure effects."}

Here, we report the effect of uniaxial stress on the\nanomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the hexagonal frustrated antiferromagnetic\nHeusler compound Mn3Ge. Our x-ray diffraction results show that the c/a ratio\nvaries linearly with strain when stress is applied along the a axis, as well as\na significantly higher Young's modulus along the c direction. The linear\nbehavior of the c/a ratio under uniaxial stress mirrors that seen under\nhydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa, but results in a characteristically\ndifferent behavior of the AHE. Stress applied along the a axis induces a\ndistortion in the ab plane, smoothing the abrupt jump in the AHE signal at zero\nmagnetic field. In contrast, stress applied along the c axis has little effect,\npresumably due to the higher Young's modulus. We argue that this is due to\npronounced changes in magnetic order."}
