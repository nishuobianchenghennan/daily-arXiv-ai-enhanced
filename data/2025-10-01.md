Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate valid scientific
hypotheses for materials synthesis remains largely unquantified, hindered by
the absence of benchmarks probing physicochemical logics reasoning. To address
this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated
hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground
their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that
our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms
standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational
efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs
toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science. The
MatterMech benchmark and associated code is publicly available at
\href{https://github.com/amair-lab/MatterMech}{GitHub}.

Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband THz radiation via
ultrafast spin-charge conversion in magnetic multilayers, offering spectral
coverage beyond that of photoconductive antennas and nonlinear optical
crystals. Here, we demonstrate a new type of STE based on PtxAu100-x alloy that
achieves signifi- cantly higher THz output power than widely used Pt-based
devices. Alloy composition and layer thickness tuning yield Pt75Au25 as the
optimal alloy providing a 30 % increase in THz power in CoFeB/Pt75Au25 bilayer
STEs compared to the optimized CoFeB/Pt reference STE. In W/CoFeB/Pt75Au25
trilayer STEs, we observe a 10 % higher THz power than in the optimized
W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer. The STE efficiency is reduced upon annealing for both
Pt75Au25- and Pt-based STEs due to formation of interfacial alloys. Our results
establish Pt75Au25 as a promising platform for high-performance STEs, where its
giant spin Hall effect significantly enhances efficiency over conventional
Pt-based devices.

Abstract: Conventional metals, insulators, and semimetals are constrained by
fundamental limitations in terms of their thermoelectric performance.
Topological materials offer certain features that allow them to circumvent
these constraints, and potentially to form the basis for thermoelectric devices
with unprecedented efficiency. In this article we review the thermoelectric
performance of topological materials, focusing specifically on nodal
semimetals, such as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. We discuss how certain
unique ``topological'' features of these materials -- namely their
topologically protected band touching points, electron-hole degenerate lowest
Landau level, and Berry curvature -- allow them to exhibit thermoelectric
properties that go beyond what is possible in conventional materials,
particularly in the presence of an applied magnetic field. We focus our
discussion on the goal of achieving large figure of merit $zT$, and for each
material class we summarize optimal \emph{design principles} for selecting
materials that maximize thermoelectric efficiency.
  We then use these optimal design principles to design and implement a
high-throughput database search for topological semimetals that are promising
as thermoelectrics. In addition to highlighting a number of materials that are
already known to have large magnetothermoelectric effects, our search uncovers
twelve additional materials that are especially promising for near-future
experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we develop an atomistic, graph-based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
simulation routine to predict crystal morphology. Within this routine, we
encode the state of the supercell in a binary occupation vector and the
topology of the supercell in a simple nearest-neighbor graph. From this
encoding, we efficiently compute the interaction energy of the system as a
quadratic form of the binary occupation vector, representing pairwise
interactions. This encoding, coupled with a simple diffusion model for
adsorption, is then used to model evaporation and adsorption dynamics at
solid-liquid interfaces. The resulting intermolecular interaction-breaking
energies are incorporated into a kinetic model to predict crystal morphology,
which is implemented in the open-source Python package Crystal Growth Kinetic
Monte Carlo (cgkmc). We then apply this routine to pentaerythritol tetranitrate
(PETN), an important energetic material, showing excellent agreement with the
attachment energy model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Edelstein effect consists of the non-equilibrium accumulation of
magnetization in response to an applied electric field in systems with broken
inversion symmetry. While the spin Edelstein effect (SEE), originating from
spin moments, is well established, its orbital counterpart, where magnetization
arises from orbital moment, has only recently begun to attract attention. In
this work, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) in gated monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, by using
first-principles density-functional calculations with both electron and hole
doping. The gate-induced broken mirror symmetry produces a Rashba-type chiral
spin/orbital angular momentum texture, which in turn leads to the Edelstein
effect in response to an applied in-plane electric field. We find that for
electron doping the Edelstein response is dominated by the orbital channel,
whereas for hole doping the orbital and spin contributions are comparable. For
the case of hole doping, both OEE and SEE are strongly enhanced by a small
amount of strain, due to strain-driven shifts between the Gamma and K/K' valley
energies. We derive analytical expressions for the spin and orbital Edelstein
susceptibilities and evaluate their magnitudes from first-principles.
Remarkably, the predicted OEE in gated monolayer TMDs is an order of magnitude
larger than values reported in previously studied systems. Our results identify
TMDs as promising platforms for studying the orbital Edelstein effect and
highlight their potential applications in spintronics devices.

Abstract: This study examines lithium distribution and its evolution in both anode and
cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate
cycling, providing insights into lithium loss, trapping, and plating
mechanisms. Cells were cycled at 1C to 3C rates, and post-mortem analysis were
performed using Li nuclear reaction Analysis (Li-NRA), x-ray diffraction (XRD),
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy (EDS). Li-NRA using the resonant nuclear reaction between an
incident high-energy proton and lithium was used to measure the depth
distribution of Li in the cathode and anode layers. The Li-NRA analysis
revealed a surface lithium peak on the anode, likely associated with SEI
formation and lithium plating, while the cathode exhibited a decrease in
lithium content by ~19.7%. XRD analysis of the cathode showed a contraction of
the c-lattice parameter and peak shifts consistent with lithium depletion and
structural deformation, supported by SEM imaging. In contrast, the dead
graphite anode shows an enhanced peak at 43.3{\deg}, which corresponds to the
presence of metallic lithium or possibly Cu. 3-C rate cycling also led to
capacity fade and an increase in internal resistance, highlighting the impact
of lithium plating on cell performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted workflows have transformed materials
discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical spaces of functional
materials. Endowed with extraordinary optoelectronic properties,
two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites represent an exciting frontier, but
current efforts to design 2D perovskites rely heavily on trial-and-error and
expert intuition approaches, leaving most of the chemical space unexplored and
compromising the design of hybrid materials with desired properties. Here, we
introduce an inverse design workflow for Dion-Jacobson perovskites that is
built on an invertible fingerprint representation for millions of conjugated
diammonium organic spacers. By incorporating high-throughput density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, interpretable machine learning, and synthesis
feasibility screening, we identified new organic spacer candidates with
deterministic energy level alignment between the organic and the inorganic
motifs in the 2D hybrid perovskites. These results highlight the power of
integrating invertible, physically meaningful molecular representations into
AI-assisted design, streamlining the property-targeted design of hybrid
materials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Oxide Li-conducting solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer excellent chemical
and thermal stability but typically exhibit lower ionic conductivity than
sulfides and chlorides. This motivates the search for new oxide materials with
enhanced conductivity. Crystal structure prediction is a powerful approach for
identifying such candidates. However, the structural complexity of oxide SSEs,
often involving unit cells with more than 100 atoms, presents significant
challenges for conventional methods. In this study, we introduce TOPIC, a
structure prediction algorithm that reduces configurational complexity by
enforcing corner-sharing (CS) bond topology constraints. We demonstrate that
TOPIC successfully reproduces the ground-state and metastable structures of
known oxide SSEs, including LiTa$_2$PO$_8$ and Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$,
which contain up to about 200 atoms per unit cell. By combining this approach
with a pretrained machine-learning interatomic potential, we systematically
screen quaternary oxide compositions and identify 92 promising candidates with
CS frameworks. In particular, Li$_4$Hf$_2$Si$_3$O$_{12}$, which corresponds to
the ground state at its composition, exhibits an ionic conductivity of 14 mS
cm$^{-1}$, a hull energy of 21 meV atom$^{-1}$, and a band gap of 6.5 eV.
Through our investigation, we identify the Li ratio as one of the key factors
determining the stability of CS structures. Overall, our approach provides a
practical and scalable pathway for discovering high-performance oxide solid
electrolytes in previously unexplored chemical spaces.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate prediction of surface energies and stabilities is essential for
materials design, yet first-principles calculations remain computationally
expensive and most existing interatomic potentials are trained only on bulk
systems. Here, we demonstrate that fine-tuning foundation machine learning
potentials (MLPs) significantly improves both computational efficiency and
predictive accuracy for surface modeling. While existing universal interatomic
potentials (UIPs) have been solely trained and validated on bulk datasets, we
extend their applicability to complex and scientifically significant unary,
binary, and ternary surface systems. We systematically compare models trained
from scratch, zero-shot inference, conventional fine-tuning, and multi-head
fine-tuning approach that enhances transferability and mitigates catastrophic
forgetting. Fine-tuning consistently reduces prediction errors with
orders-of-magnitude fewer training configurations, and multi-head fine-tuning
delivers robust and generalizable predictions even for materials beyond the
initial training domain. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging
pre-trained MLPs to accelerate surface modeling and highlight a scalable path
toward data-efficient, next-generation atomic-scale simulations in
computational materials science.

Abstract: Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present rich
dynamics that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current
polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin
polarization, in agreement with expectations in older works. Propagating walls
are obtained for an in-plane polarization. We obtain the velocity as a function
of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is
found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, the main features of the
wall profile are obtained by a direct solution of an equation that is valid in
a limiting case. We discuss the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find
that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations.
Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for spin polarization that has
both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is
given.

Abstract: Defects in high temperature superconductors such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO)
critically influence their superconducting behavior, as they substantially
degrade or even suppress superconductivity. With the renewed interest in
cuprates for next-generation superconducting magnets operating in
radiation-harsh environments such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators,
accurate atomistic modeling of defects and their dynamics has become essential.
Here, we present a general-purpose machine-learning interatomic potential for
YBCO, based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) method and trained on Density
Functional Theory (DFT) data, with particular emphasis on defects and their
diffusion mechanisms. The potential is validated against DFT calculations of
ground-state properties, defect formation energies of oxygen Frenkel pairs and
diffusion barriers for their formation. Remarkably, the potential captures the
diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition at elevated
temperatures, a transformation that is difficult to describe with empirical
potentials, elucidating how the formation of oxygen Frenkel pairs in the basal
plane governs this order-disorder transition. The ACE potential introduced here
enables large-scale, predictive atomistic simulations of defect dynamics and
transport processes in YBCO, providing a powerful tool to explore its
stability, performance, and functionality under realistic operating conditions.
Moreover, this work proves that machine learning interatomic potentials are
suitable for studies of quaternary oxides with complex chemistry.

Abstract: The kinetics of the photochromic reaction of oxygen-containing rare-earth
hydrides is commonly described by an exponential function assuming a
single-step process. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of the
photochromic effect in oxygen-containing rare-earth metal hydrides, considering
the kinetics of the reaction as a two-step process. We show that the fit to the
experimental data is improved drastically when two processes that cause the
photodarkening are assumed: a fast reaction rate-limited - for example,
electronic or local - process and a slow, e.g. diffusion-limited process.

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) supports a wide range of two-dimensional (2D)
technologies, yet assessing its crystalline quality over large areas remains a
fundamental challenge. Both antiparallel domains, an intrinsic outcome of
epitaxy on high-symmetry substrates, and orientational domains have long evaded
optical detection. Here, we show that interferometric second-harmonic
generation (SHG) polarimetry provides a powerful, non-destructive probe of
lattice orientation and structural integrity in chemical vapor deposition-grown
hBN. This approach reveals the ubiquitous formation of antiparallel domains and
quantifies their impact on crystalline order. SHG intensity also emerges as a
direct optical metric of domain disorder, spanning three orders of magnitude
across films produced by ten different growth routes. Correlation with Raman
spectroscopy establishes a unified framework for evaluating crystalline
quality. Beyond hBN, this method offers a high-throughput route to wide-area
structural imaging in other non-centrosymmetric 2D materials, advancing their
deployment in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of
next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant
with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening
has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the
ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric
performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that
predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and
phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic
dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This
approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the
proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a
screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.

Abstract: Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense
memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In
rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of
topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 fractional hotspots,
termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted
barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized
effective-Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the
chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half
hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3
quarks). The two share the same six-vortex skeleton but differ by an integer +1
per vortex in the plane-integrated slice charge. In random BZT, nanodomains
remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and
distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass like state
with fluctuations of the topological charge along the axis. Thermal stability
maps show that pure BT retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the
critical temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting
competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly,
the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling
field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered
system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under
the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically
programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room
temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.

Abstract: In this study we have derived an exact framework for the calculation of the
heat flux and its spec- tral decomposition in Molecular Dynamics (MD) for
arbitrary many-body potentials. This work addresses several lacks and
limitations of previous approaches and allows for the accurate computa- tional
study of thermal properties in a wide variety of many-body systems with MD. We
have tested our modifications with Green-Kubo (GK) and Non-Equilibrium MD
(NEMD) simulations for vari- ous 2D and 3D material systems using the Tersoff
and Stillinger-Weber potentials as examples. The spectral decomposition of the
heat current was also calculated for monolayer graphene (1LG) and MoS2 , for
different system lengths. Our results show that the heat current calculated by
our method is consistently in agreement with the thermostat current in NEMD,
while previous implementations can estimate quite poorly the thermal
conductivity both under GK and NEMD simulations, and both for 2D and 3D
materials. The decomposition of the heat current also sheds light on the con-
tribution of different phonon modes to thermal conductivity and its dependence
on length. Our methodology is implemented in the widely used LAMMPS code
specifically for the Tersoff and SW potentials, and it is readily applicable to
the vast majority of many-body MD potentials.

Abstract: The properties of spin fluctuations in antiferromagnets are largely
unexplored, in particular at ultrafast timescales. Here, we employ femtosecond
noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) to experimentally study magnetization
fluctuations in the canted antiferromagnet Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ across
its spin reorientation transition and under external magnetic fields. By
comparing our measurements to atomistic spin noise and Monte Carlo simulations,
we find that the amplitude of the spin noise is governed by the free energy,
with stronger fluctuations in regions where the potential landscape softens. We
furthermore demonstrate that external magnetic fields suppress spin
fluctuations and enhance the quasi-ferromagnetic magnon frequency by
effectively stiffening the potential. These results highlight an effective
route for tuning ultrafast magnetization fluctuations via external parameters.

Abstract: Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) glasses have emerged as a new family
of melt-quenched glasses. However, the vitrification of MIOC is challenging
since most of the crystalline MIOC precursors decompose before melting. The
decomposition problem severely narrows the compositional range of MIOC glass
formation. Here, we report a novel approach for preparing the MIOC glasses that
combines slow-solvent-removal with subsequent quenching to avoid gel thermal
decomposition and crystallization. Specifically, the new approach utilizes an
aprotic solvent (acetone) to kinetically prevent the ordering of the
metal-ligand complex molecules in solution, thereby suppressing crystallization
and forming a gel. The subsequent gradual drying process leads to the removal
of the solvent to enhance the connections between molecules through hydrogen
bonds, thus causing the formation of a hydrogen-bonded network. The increased
network connectivity lowers the mobility of the molecules, thereby avoiding gel
crystallization. Consequently, a disordered network is frozen-in during
quenching of the dried gel from 130 {\deg}C to room temperature, and finally
MIOC glass forms. Structural analyses reveal that hydrogen bonds are
responsible for connecting the tetrahedral units. The as-prepared MIOC glass
exhibits some fascinating behaviors, e.g., Tg increasing with rapid
room-temperature relaxation, CO2 uptake, and red-shift of photoluminescence.
This work not only presents a novel strategy for fabricating large-sized,
stable, functional MIOC glasses, but also uncovers the critical role of
hydrogen bonds in MIOC glass formation.

Abstract: Achieving uniform and controlled transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) shell
growth on nanowires (NWs) remains a key challenge, limiting the development of
high-quality core-shell heterostructures for optoelectronic and photocatalytic
applications. In this work, the fabrication of ZnSe-MoSe2 and ZnSe-WSe2
core-shell NWs was successfully demonstrated. ZnSe NWs were grown via the
vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism, while TMD (MoSe2 or WSe2) shells were
formed through a two-step process of sacrificial oxide layer deposition via
magnetron sputtering followed by selenization process in a chemical vapor
transport reactor. As-grown nanostructures were characterized using X-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It was
observed that the TMD shell morphology can be controlled through the
selenization process temperature optimization, which arises due to different
growth mechanisms discussed here. The studied trends could be further extended
to other semiconductor NW and TMD core-shell heterostructure growth, offering
promising avenues for advanced nanoscale applications.

Abstract: Strain gradients, ubiquitous in flexible devices and epitaxial
nanostructures, are a major blind spot for thermal transport in \b{eta}-Ga2O3.
We establish that strain gradient unlocks a thermal conductivity (k)
suppression mechanism fundamentally more potent than uniform strain: moderate
uniaxial gradients (0.6%/nm) suppress k by 32-37% (27-30%) in thin films
(nanowires), intensifying to 43.3% with biaxial gradients. This reduction far
exceeds that from equivalent uniform strain and surpasses benchmark materials
like silicon and BAs. Critically, a surprising decoupling emerges: while 3%
uniform strain alters thermal anisotropy by ~25%, strain gradient strongly
suppresses k with preserving this ratio. Mechanistically, strain
gradients-induced symmetry breaking and enhanced mode coupling anisotropically
activate forbidden scattering channels, making gradient-driven scattering
dominant over intrinsic phonon scattering below 6.25 THz. These findings
redefine non-uniform strain from a parasitic flaw into a powerful design tool
for engineering thermal isolation and heat flux in next-generation flexible and
high-power \b{eta}-Ga2O3 electronics.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulses offer a promising route for the
ultrafast manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials. While
previous studies have demonstrated the excitation of spin dynamics using
linearly polarized THz fields, the role of circular polarization and the
effects of rapidly oscillating, time-dependent field profiles remained
insufficiently understood. We have developed a unified theoretical framework
for describing the excitation of spin precession via Zeeman interaction in
magnetic materials by high frequency pulses of arbitrary polarization with
temporal Gaussian profile. In the regime of long pulses (at least several
oscillations are within the pulse duration), a circularly polarized magnetic
field acts as an effective rectified magnetic field along the pulse
propagation, while linear polarized pulses excite no free precession. In the
regime of short pulses (less than one oscillation is within the pulse
duration), pulses of any polarization, including linear one can excite free
spin precession. There is an optimal pulse duration which maximizes amplitude
of the spin precession. It depends on magnetic parameters of the sample and the
external magnetic field, as well as on the carrier frequency of the pulse and
its amplitude. These findings bridge key gaps in the understanding of
THz-induced spin dynamics and provide insights into the design of
light-controlled magnetization schemes using tailored electromagnetic pulses.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the
microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate
identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are
critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization
pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains
governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis
is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present
an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that
enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and
defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x
architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)
Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and
fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;
and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves
fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary
recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet
achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point
Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing
model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond
segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as
lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators
of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities
establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and
data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is

Abstract: Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising low-cost and environmentally
friendly photovoltaic devices, especially when utilizing natural sensitizers.
This study explores the effect of concentration ratios of natural dyes
extracted from mangosteen peel (MP) and grass jelly leaves (GJL) on the
optical, morphological, and photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. Dye solutions
were prepared at a fixed concentration of 0.6 g/mL, with the MP:GJL volume
ratio varied at 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. As a result, UV-Vis absorption
spectra showed that the MP contributes to the UV-blue region (350-450), while
the GJL contributes to the red region (650-700 nm). The current-voltage (J-V)
analysis showed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MP and GJL dyes
is 2.75% and 2.12%. The composite dye with a 1:3 (MP:GJL) ratio yielded the
highest PCE of 3.50%, demonstrating the synergistic effect of combining these
natural sensitizers to broaden the light absorption spectrum.

Abstract: Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping
the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state
networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and
enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and
physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples
only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization
framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a
multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer
uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest
k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1
saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based
pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large
atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak
memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized
N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously
unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type
skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up
to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same
core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical
rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.

Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation
based on the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM). This new version brings
significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython
modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++
implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency
enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from
scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order. The
workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive
and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and
Chern number calculation, search of eigenvalues within a specific energy range,
analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and
tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss
the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features.
Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.

Abstract: The thermal conductivity of thin films is commonly estimated using the
3-omega experimental method. When calibrating the test setup, it is customary
to use a specimen with a known thermal conductivity for validation. However,
when determining the thermal conductivity of samples with unknown values,
numerical approximations can provide a means to validate experimental results
and ensure the integrity of the setup. A simple analytical or finite element
analysis (FEA) method can be used to achieve this. For multilayer systems of
unknown layer thermal conductivities, the 3-omega experimental setup only
provides information about the overall bulk thermal conductivity of the system.
To obtain the individual layer thermal conductivities, a combined experimental
and numerical approach can be used. This article presents a novel method for
backtracking the layer thermal conductivities of a multilayer thin film
structure using a coupled 3-omega experimental and Newton-Raphson numerical
approach. The method is validated using high-fidelity data obtained from
literature.

Abstract: Recently, novel crystalline constructions known as Cayley-Schreier lattices
have been suggested as a platform for realizing arbitrary gauge fields in
synthetic crystals with real hopping amplitudes. We show that Cayley-Schreier
lattices can naturally give rise to implementable lattice systems that
incorporate non-Abelian gauge structures transforming into a space-group
symmetry. We show that the symmetry sectors can, moreover, be interpreted as
blocks of spin models that can effectively realize a wealth of different
topological invariants in a single setup. We underpin these general results
with concrete models and show how they can be implemented in current
experimental platforms. Our work sets the stage for a systematic investigation
of topological insulators and metals with non-Abelian gauge structures.

Abstract: We demonstrate that in an ideal Weyl semimetal, in which the Fermi energy
coincides with the band-touching nodes, weak direct inter-nodal scattering is
irrelevant and, as a result, the chiral charge is (almost) exactly conserved.
This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic
field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the
conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample
cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial
topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals.

Abstract: The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention
due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the
interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles
remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of
orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons
and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in
bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion
of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the
latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional
antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum
geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking,
yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM.
We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage
generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the
bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the
emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge
between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding
magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital
degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical
control of magnetization and phononic transport.

Abstract: The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in
spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of
nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly.
In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure
spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via
a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in
systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane
electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near
the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure
spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles
calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material.
Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the
applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin
photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned
by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing
additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a
robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in
two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of
optospintronic devices.

Abstract: Ultra-small Josephson junctions are strongly influenced by noise and damping
due to energy dissipation into the environment, which are expected to suppress
phase coherence. Here, we investigate the coherence properties of atomic-scale
Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope under microwave
excitation. Plain Pb-Pb junctions exhibit hysteretic Shapiro steps as signature
of a coherent resonant state. With increasing AC amplitude, phase coherence is
reduced due to an increase of thermal fluctuations. In the presence of magnetic
adatoms the Josephson coupling energy is reduced and quasi-particle tunneling
is enhanced. With AC driving we observe a rapid suppression of coherence that
we ascribe to photon-assisted quasi-particle tunneling through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov
states. Our results highlight the presence of phase coherence and shed light on
the origin of the transition to incoherent transport, thereby revealing the
importance of controlling dissipation in nanoscale superconducting devices.

learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are
able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and
its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application
of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a
hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space
topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and
generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a
tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying
the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights
the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping
stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning

Abstract: Altermagnets possess two key features: non-relativistic alternating spin
splitting (i.e., altermagnetism) and a material-dependent N\'{e}el vector. The
former naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real
materials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic
properties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage,
making it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we
study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional
(2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the N\'{e}el vector
orientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the N\'{e}el
vector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC,
or qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a
novel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports,
whose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC.
Additionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY
spin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be
determined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic
term; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same
moderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin
model with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates
also relies on the N\'{e}el vector orientation and impurity configurations. All
results are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in
prior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed
N\'{e}el vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic
properties of altermagnets.

Abstract: Energy harvesting is a technique that generates useful work from waste heat.
Conventional energy harvesters acting on local thermal equilibrium states are
constrained by thermodynamic limits, such as the Carnot efficiency. Quantum
heat engines with non-thermal reservoirs are expected to exceed such limits.
Here, we demonstrate energy harvesting from a nonthermal Tomonaga-Luttinger
(TL) liquid in quantum Hall edge channels, where the non-thermal state is
naturally formed due to the absence of thermalization. The scheme is tested
with a quantum-dot energy harvester working on a non-thermal TL liquid supplied
with waste heat from a quantum-point-contact transistor. Compared to the
quasi-thermalized TL liquid, the non-thermal state prepared under the same heat
is capable of a larger electromotive force and higher conversion efficiency.
These characteristics can be understood by considering a binary Fermi
distribution function of the non-thermal state induced by entropy-conserving
equilibration. TL liquids are attractive non-thermal carriers for excellent
energy harvesting.

tunability of the output spiking frequency and the shape of the spiking
waveform are also demonstrated to provide suitable voltage spikes for the

Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new high temperature

the interplay of lattice structure and magnetism in this system. Using
state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show
that $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ spin stripe order emerges in our model and exhibits a
hidden quasi-one dimensionality. The spin stripe order occurs over a range of
electron concentrations, but requires a sizable Hund's coupling $J_H$. Our
model exhibits superconducting tendency only when the interlayer
antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\bot$ becomes sufficiently large, which naturally
occurs under pressure. Our study unveils the microscopic origin of both the
unusual spin stripes and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and highlights
the indispensable role of Hund's coupling $J_H$ in this system.

Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q,
high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an
apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well
below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate
surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on
highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle
sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and
superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are
calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of
electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss
Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in
superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on
impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the
effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen
infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness
tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion
of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of
impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights,
ensuring uniformity.

essential for fundamental understanding and also for the use of these films in
technological applications. In the present study, Ti40V60 alloy thin films have
been deposited using DC magnetron co sputtering of Ti and V at ambient
temperatures. The effect of deposition pressure on the film morphology,
superconducting and normal state properties has been studied. Measurement of
electrical resistance as a function of temperature indicates that up to a
certain deposition pressure, the 20 nm thick Ti40V60 films exhibit metallic
behavior in the normal state and superconductivity at low temperatures. Beyond
a threshold pressure, the films show a negative temperature coefficient of
resistance with a residual resistance ratio less than one. Electrical transport
measurements in the presence of magnetic field were performed to find the
current voltage characteristics of the thin films. Analysis of the I V curves
indicates that the Ti40V60 alloy thin films have a large transport critical
current density (JC) e.g. 1.475E10 A per m2 in zero magnetic field and 2.657E09
A per m2 in 4 T (both at 4 K). Analysis of the field dependence of flux line
pinning force density indicates a combined effect of core delta k surface and
core delta k point pinning mechanisms (where k is the Ginzburg Landau
parameter). Additionally, spatial variations in the superconducting critical
temperature (TC ) across the sample contribute to delta TC pinning. In higher
magnetic fields, a contribution from delta l pinning (where l is the electron
mean free path) also becomes significant. The findings indicate the potential
of Ti40V60 alloy thin film for superconducting device applications like
cryogenic radiation detectors.

Abstract: Amorphous thin film superconductors are promising alternatives for the
development of superconducting radiation detectors, especially superconducting
nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) and superconducting microwire single
photon detectors (SWSPDs), due to their homogeneous nature, ease of deposition,
and superconducting parameters comparable to the materials currently being
used. A study on the optimization of the growth technology and superconducting
transition temperature (TC) of MoSi thin films grown on SiO2 coated Si
substrate is reported here. These films have been synthesized by co sputtering
of Mo and Si targets with varying compositions and thicknesses to achieve
optimized TC values close to that of the bulk. Mo80Si20 and Mo83Si17
compositions of the film, each with a thickness of 17 nm, exhibited the highest
TC of 6.4 K and 5.9 K, respectively. Additionally, a meander structure with a
17 um wire width was patterned to estimate the transport critical current
density (JC), which was measured to be 1.4E9 A per m2 at 4 K. Variation of the
TC with film thickness and deposition pressure has been studied. Electrical
resistance as a function of temperature of the film before and after meandering
was also studied. These properties are compatible with the fabrication of
superconducting nanowire, microwire and wide strip single photon detectors.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting gap structures in wallpaper
fermions, which are surface states of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline
insulators, based on a two-dimensional effective model. A symmetry analysis
identifies six types of momentum-independent pair potentials. One hosts a point
node, two host line nodes, and the remaining three are fully gapped. By
classifying the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in the zero-dimensional
symmetry class, we show that the point and line nodes are protected by
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. In addition, for the
twofold-rotation-odd pair potential, nodes appear on the glide-invariant line
and are protected by crystalline symmetries, as clarified by the
Mackey--Bradley theorem.

Abstract: The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap
and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type
Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The
real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by
microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show
that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of
4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The
effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy
the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic
state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole
per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the
Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the
half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic
molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed
by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules
obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs
with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes
in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet,
which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface
of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular
orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction
between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between
itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized
molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of
superconductivity in cuprates.

Abstract: The Nernst effect in superconductors is typically linked to fluctuating
Cooper pairs above $T_c$ or vortex motion below $T_c$. We show instead that
Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles can generate an intrinsic Nernst
response in a clean, vortex-free superconducting state. Focusing on
two-dimensional (2D) systems with Ising spin-orbit coupling, relevant to
transition-metal dichalcogenides, we identify two regimes: an intervalley
$s$-wave paired state where a weak magnetic field activates the effect, and an
intravalley chiral $p$-wave paired state that exhibits a spontaneous charge or
spin Nernst response without a field. We propose an experimental setup that
circumvents screening and provide estimates of the signal magnitude. Our
results establish the Nernst effect as a direct probe of Berry curvature and
pairing symmetry in 2D spin-orbit-coupled superconductors.

Abstract: We study ultralight scalar fields with quadratic couplings to Standard-Model
fermions and derive strong constraints from white-dwarf mass-radius data. Such
couplings source scalar profiles inside compact stars, shift fermion masses,
and can produce a new ground state of matter. We analyze couplings to electrons
and to nucleons, incorporating composition and finite-temperature effects in
white dwarf structure and equations of state. We identify two robust
observables: (i) forbidden gaps - ranges of radii with no stable configurations
- and (ii) characteristic shape distortions that drive white dwarf masses
toward the Chandrasekhar limit (electron couplings) or shift the maximum mass
(nucleon couplings). Confronting these predictions with precise measurements
for Sirius B and Procyon B, together with the global white dwarf population,
excludes large regions of unexplored parameter space and extends earlier
QCD-axion-specific bounds to a broader class of scalar theories. Our stellar
constraints rely only on sourcing and do not assume the scalar constitutes dark
matter; where mass reductions are small, precision laboratory searches remain
competitive. White-dwarf astrophysics thus provides a powerful, largely
assumption-minimal probe of ultralight, quadratically coupled scalars.

Abstract: We point out that ultralight scalar dark matter that modulates neutrino
masses can be significantly thermal damped by cosmic neutrinos in the early
universe. This dissipative effect arises as a backreaction from the neutrinos
which are being driven slightly out of thermal equilibrium by the scalar. We
estimate the rate of such thermal damping and explore its phenomenological
implications. For a scalar that is produced early, we find that the effect of
thermal damping results in a predictable final abundance largely insensitive to
its initial condition while circumventing late time limits. This motivates a
parameter-space line to target experimentally.

Abstract: Injecting 1-13.6 eV photons into the early universe can suppress the
molecular hydrogen abundance and alter the star formation history dramatically
enough to produce direct collapse black holes. These, in turn, could explain
the recently observed population of puzzling high-redshift supermassive black
holes that appear to require super-Eddington accretion. We show that axion dark
matter decay in the intergalactic medium can account for this energy injection.
We use a single zone model of the gas core and semi-analytically evolve its
chemo-thermal properties to track the conditions for which the system becomes
an atomic cooling halo-a necessary precursor for the production of heavy black
hole seeds to explain the high-redshift black hole population. Windows of
axions masses between 24.5-26.5 eV with photon couplings as low as $4\times
10^{-12}$/GeV may realize this atomic cooling halo condition. We highlight the
significance of the band structure of molecular hydrogen on the effectiveness
of this process and discuss estimates of the heavy seed population and
prospects for testing this model.

Abstract: The pattern of neutrino mixing, usually parameterized by the
Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata $U_{\rm PMNS}$ matrix, still remains a striking
puzzle in particle physics. $U_{\rm PMNS}$ is one of six possible products of
multiplying three Euler matrices. Here we discuss the neutrino mixing matrix
parameterization for three known flavours of neutrinos based on the SO(3) group
represented by one three-dimensional rotation matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$. The mixing
matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$ with cyclic order of the Lie group generators implies
$\delta_{\rm{CP}}=180^\circ$ for clockwise rotation in three dimensions, a
viable scenario for normal mass ordering. We determine a range of rotation
angles for $U_{\rm SO3}$ which deviate substantially from the almost maximal
mixings in the standard $U_{\rm PMNS}$ scenario, yielding `democratic' values
for the mixing angles. With the fixed $\delta_{\rm CP}$ value, the $U_{\rm
SO3}$ parameterization can be validated or falsified by the next generation of
neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and puts a stringent constraint on
the absolute neutrino mass. The proposed $U_{\rm SO3}$ neutrino mixing
parameterization is suited for independent CP-conserving neutrino oscillation
experimental analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which
is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice
simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW
area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically,
its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR
modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the
area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value
$\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of
non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary.
Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one
recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally
suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the
scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may
affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor
five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice
of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we
revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has
been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly
earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the
potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation
and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger
upon removing IR modes in simulations.

Abstract: We present a new analysis on sterile neutrino cosmologies using the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release (DR2) baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements in combination with cosmic microwave
background (CMB), CMB lensing, and supernova data. We show that BAO observables
are intrinsically less sensitive to the combined effects of relativistic energy
density, $N_{\rm eff}$, and the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, which
are both augmented in sterile neutrino cosmologies. With SH0ES local expansion
rate, $H_0$, data, we find $N_{\rm eff} = 3.43 \pm 0.13$, reducing the Hubble
tension to $2.4\sigma$. For a 0.1~eV sterile neutrino, we find $N_{\rm
eff}=3.50$ as the best fit. For this representative $N_{\rm eff}$, we find an
upper limit of $m_s < 0.17$ eV (95\% CL), greater than a factor of four weaker
than standard constraints on $\Sigma m_\nu$. When SH0ES is included, light
sterile neutrinos with masses $m_s\simeq0.1$--$0.2$ eV are favored at $\gtrsim
3\sigma$, whereas eV-scale sterile masses remain strongly excluded by the data
in the cosmologies we study. Our findings confirm our previous results that
partially thermalized sub-eV sterile neutrinos are preferred by the SH0ES $H_0$
data. The preferred $m_s$ mass scale overlaps with, but is not identical to,
that favored in neutrino oscillation solutions to short-baseline anomalies.

at zero chemical potential resembles the lattice results. Moreover, it is found
that both the temperature derivative of the eletric conductivity and thermal

Abstract: We review recent applications of nonlocal effective field theory, focusing in
particular on nonlocal chiral effective theory and nonlocal quantum
electrodynamics (QED), as well as an extension of nonlocal effective theory to
curved spacetime. For the chiral effective theory, we discuss the calculation
of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the nucleon at nonzero skewness,
along with the corresponding gravitational (or mechanical) form factors, within
the convolution framework. In the QED application, we extend the nonlocal
formulation to construct the most general nonlocal QED interaction, in which
both the propagator and fundamental QED vertex are modified due to the nonlocal
Lagrangian, while preserving the Ward-Green-Takahashi identities. For
consistency with the modified propagator, a solid quantization is proposed, and
the nonlocal QED is applied to explain the lepton $g-2$ anomalies without the
introduction of new particles or interactions. Finally, with an extension of
the chiral effective action to curved spacetime, we investigate the nonlocal
energy-momentum tensor and gravitational form factors of the nucleon with a
nonlocal pion-nucleon interaction.

Abstract: Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields,
  from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology.
  It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of
the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$.
However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime.
In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a
case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles.
  We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic
monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds
for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers
and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a
crucial role in the helicity change.
  The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we
discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the
chiral anomaly in the early universe.

Considering the present estimations, we propose to search for

invariant spectra. Their ratios may serve as an important test of the molecular

Abstract: The quality of the invariant mass reconstruction of the di-{\tau} system is
crucial for searches and analyses of di-{\tau} resonances. Due to the presence
of neutrinos in the final state, the {\tau} {\tau} invariant mass cannot be
calculated directly at hadron colliders, where the longitudinal momentum sum
constraint cannot be applied. A number of approaches have been adopted to
mitigate this issue. The most general one uses Matrix Element (ME) integration
for likelihood estimation, followed by invariant mass reconstruction as the
value maximizing the likelihood. However, this method has a significant
computational cost due to the need for integration over the phase space of the
decay products. We propose an algorithm that reduces the computational cost by
two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the resolution of the invariant mass
reconstruction at a level comparable to the ME-based method. Moreover, we
introduce additional features to estimate the uncertainty of the reconstructed
mass and the kinematics of the initial {\tau} leptons (e.g., their momenta).

Abstract: We revisit the 95 GeV excesses in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau\tau$ channels
in the Georgi-Machacek model, where a single light $CP$-even custodial singlet
$H$ can account for both hints. Using one-loop renormalization group-improved
effective potential and positive-definiteness conditions for vacuum stability,
together with perturbative unitarity, electroweak precision tests, $B$-physics,
and Higgs data, we identify a narrow but viable parameter region. In this
region, charged and doubly charged scalars enhance $H\to\gamma\gamma$, while
the fermionic rescaling controls $H\to\tau\tau$, yielding combined signal
strengths compatible at the $2\sigma$ level. The scenario predicts
characteristic patterns in the singlet mixing and triplet VEV and is highly
testable at the HL-LHC and future lepton colliders via precision $\kappa_V$
measurements and direct exotic searches.

Abstract: We discuss an observable that probes the content of a QCD medium at finite
temperature and chemical potential, the net quark number gain. It is the
response of the thermal bath to a static quark or antiquark probe. While
insignificant at high temperatures, it reveals the bath's tendency to form
meson-like or baryon-like configurations (depending on the probe and chemical
potential) at low temperatures, which would screen the probe's color charge.
The net quark number gain also helps explain how a single quark/antiquark can
be added to a supposedly confining medium in the first place: the latter
provides the missing quarks/antiquarks to form hadron-like states. We sketch
the derivation of this general result for temperatures much smaller than the
constituent quark masses and discuss possible further applications to study the
various features of the QCD phase diagram.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles traversing the Sun can lose energy through elastic
scattering with solar nuclei and become gravitationally captured. For DM with
masses below a few GeV, however, evaporation caused by collisions with hot
nuclei efficiently ejects particles, preventing their long-term accumulation.
This defines a minimum mass threshold, typically around a few GeV, below which
the Sun cannot retain DM. In this work, we investigate how an additional
evaporation barrier - arising either from multiple scattering in an optically
thick regime or from a long-range DM-nucleon interaction - modifies this
equilibrium. We compute the transport and thermalization of captured DM using a
phase-space approach that evolves the orbital distribution rather than assuming
a Maxwellian form. Without a barrier, we recover the standard result that
evaporation dominates for sub-few-GeV DM, leading to negligible net retention.
With a barrier, however, the escape of light DM is strongly suppressed,
enabling the Sun to capture and retain particles below the canonical
evaporation mass. The barrier effectively raises the escape threshold, either
through repeated scatterings or through an additional long-range attractive
potential. We present the resulting phase-space distributions, density and
velocity profiles, and highlight how the suppression of the high-velocity tail
drives the captured population closer to thermal equilibrium with the solar
core. These modifications increase the equilibrium abundance of light DM by
orders of magnitude and have direct implications for solar neutrino searches as
an indirect probe of DM.

G, we also extract a novel dynamic scaling function that describes the

Abstract: The baryonic $b\to s$ transition $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda^{(*)}\nu{\bar\nu}$ is
analyzed. We combine the mesonic counterpart $B^+\to K^+\nu{\bar\nu}$ and
$B^0\to K^{*0}\nu{\bar\nu}$ as well as other observables involving $B$ mesons
like $R(K^{(*)})$, ${\rm Br}(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$, ${\rm Br}(B^+\to
K^+\mu^+\mu^-)$, and $P_5'(B^+\to K^{*+}\mu^+\mu^-)$. We find that the new
physics scale $M_{\rm NP}$ to be $2.04~{\rm TeV}\le M_{\rm NP} \le 11.76~{\rm
TeV}$ (at $1\sigma$) for ordinary heavy new mediators. Our predictions for the
branching ratios ${\rm Br}(\Lambda_b\to\Lambda^{(*)}\nu{\bar\nu})$ are $2.07
(1.07)$ times the standard model estimations, which could be verified at future
colliders.

Abstract: The effective kinetic theory (EKT) of QCD provides a possible picture of
various non-equilibrium processes in heavy- and light-ion collisions. While
there have been substantial advances in simulating the EKT in simple systems
with enhanced symmetry, eventually, event-by-event simulations will be required
for a comprehensive phenomenological modeling. As of now, these simulations are
prohibitively expensive due to the numerical complexity of the Monte Carlo
evaluation of the collision kernels. In this talk, we show how the evaluation
of the collision kernels can be performed using neural networks paving the way
to full event-by-event simulations.

Abstract: We obtain the collision kernel and related dipole cross section during the

crucial input for jet quenching calculations. We further compute the gluon
splitting rates in the AMY formalism resulting from this nonequilibrium kernel.
Comparing with thermal and commonly used forms, we find that particularly the
gluon splitting rate for parton energies of the order of the hard effective
temperature significantly differs from these approximations.

Abstract: Hard processes in collider experiments typically produce QCD jets, which have
long served as precision tests of QCD in the vacuum. More recently, heavy-ion
programs at RHIC and the LHC have offered a novel perspective on jets,
establishing them as unique probes of strongly interacting matter. Experimental
observations, including the suppression of high-$p_T$ hadrons and jets, provide
compelling evidence for the formation of a new state of matter and its strong
coupling to energetic partons.
  These advances have motivated new theoretical approaches to jet quenching
that go beyond standard perturbative techniques, aiming to elucidate the
mechanisms of energy dissipation and thermalization of energetic partons in the
quark-gluon plasma. This review highlights recent progress, beginning with a
unified description of medium-induced radiation across the
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regime and its role in turbulent gluon cascades. We
then examine radiative corrections that renormalize the transport coefficient
$\hat q$, the mechanism of color decoherence in multi-parton systems, and
nonlinear QCD evolution equations for jet energy loss. Finally, we confront
this framework with experimental measurements, underscoring the need for
precision phenomenology to fully exploit the rich data sets from RHIC and the
LHC.

identical fermions occupying the same state. What initially seems to be a
contradiction turns out to be a key element in how the Pauli exclusion
principle manifests itself in scattering theory. The discussion is entirely
basic and could easily fit into any quantum field theory textbook. To the best
of our knowledge, however, this point has not been addressed in the literature,
and we aim to fill this gap.

Abstract: We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to
bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing
possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might
nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that
superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality,
provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is,
once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large.
In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined
ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of
driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise
to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in
this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We
further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of
spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are
obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim
et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime
of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.

Abstract: We develop a theory of the non-equilibrium current response for metallic
systems near quantum critical points where electronic quasiparticles
fractionalize, such as systems near continuous metal-insulator transitions or
composite Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transitions. Applying a generalized
response theory within a Keldysh path integral framework, we derive a
non-perturbative current noise composition law, wherein the total noise is the
sum of the noise of each fractionalized constituent (bosonic holons and
fermionic spinons), weighted by their respective resistivities. We demonstrate
that the formally derived composition relations can be interpreted in terms of
a simple analogy with resistors in series. We leverage this composition rule
near certain quantum critical points to show that the shot noise can be
suppressed in long nanowires as compared to Fermi liquid expectations due to
the collusion of quantum criticality with fractionalization.

Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the
non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered
imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization,
respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity,
mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and
self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal
entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be
capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ
model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In
addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its
effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the
Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed
through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably,
the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional
points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find
that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity
strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
regime of the XXZ model.

Abstract: The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model with a quantum spin liquid
ground state. While this model was originally proposed as an $S=1/2$ spin model
on a honeycomb lattice, extensions to higher-spin systems have recently
attracted attention. In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models
are not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin
excitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model,
which is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model
using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as
fractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic
spin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a
quantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models.
Based on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure
factors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with
respect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong
spectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in
the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we
propose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond
operators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior
disappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is
consistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the
temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the
zero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature
increases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of
spinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different
momentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies.

Abstract: Single crystals of EuPd$_3$Si$_2$ were grown using a high-temperature
EuPd-flux method. The material was structurally and chemically characterized by
single-crystal x-ray diffraction, powder x-ray diffraction, Laue method and
energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The structural analysis confirmed the
orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in
the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by
Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with
an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical
resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions
indicating antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N1}= 61\,\rm K$ and a spin
reorientation at $T_{\rm N2}= 40\,\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows
magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes,
which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility
data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\rm
N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an
arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published
work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study show AFM
order below $T_{\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher
$T_{\rm C1}=78\,\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the
structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling
constants of the RKKY interaction.

Abstract: We performed high-field magnetization, magnetocaloric effect (MCE), and NMR
measurements on the Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet
Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$. The observations of the 1/3-magnetization plateau, the
split NMR lines, and the thermal activation behaviors of the spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ between 2 T and 15.8 T provide unambiguous evidence of
a gapped up-up-down (UUD) magnetic ordered phase. For fields between 15.8 T and
18.5 T, the anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility, the slow saturation of the
NMR line spectral ratio with temperature, and the power-law temperature
dependence of $1/T_1$ suggest the ground state to be a spin supersolid with
gapless spin excitations. With further increasing the field, the Gr\"{u}neisen
ratio, extracted from the MCE data, reveals a continuous quantum phase
transition at $H_{\rm C}\approx$ 19.5 T and a universal quantum critical
scaling with the exponents ${\nu}z~\approx~$1. Near $H_{\rm C}$, the large
high-temperature MCE signal and the broad peaks in the NMR Knight shift and
$1/T_1$, manifest the strong spin fluctuations driven by both magnetic
frustration and quantum criticality. These results establish
Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ as a candidate platform for cryogenic magnetocaloric
cooling.

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration
-- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in
the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (cSYK) model with a conserved U(1) charge.
Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement
entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric
product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with
the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent
decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size
effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual
cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum
Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach
lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more
robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower
bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity,
identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism.
These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry
restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in
fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.

Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations and band topology is a central
theme in modern condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the
effects of on-site Hubbard interactions on the topological, magnetic, and
quantum geometric properties of the Creutz ladder, a paradigmatic model of a
one-dimensional topological insulator. Using a self-consistent mean-field
approach, we uncover a first-order, interaction-driven phase transition that is
simultaneously magnetic and topological. We demonstrate that as the Hubbard
interaction $U$ is increased, the system's ground state abruptly switches from
an anti-ferromagnetic (AF) configuration to a ferromagnetic (F) one. This
magnetic transition coincides with a topological transition, marked by a
quantized jump in the Zak phase from $\pm\pi$ to $0$. We systematically compute
the phase diagrams in the parameter space of on-site energy staggering
($\epsilon$) and inter-chain hopping asymmetry ($\lambda$), revealing the
critical interaction strength $U_c$. Furthermore, we analyze the quantum
geometry of the Bloch states by calculating the Fubini-Study metric,
demonstrating that its components exhibit divergences that precisely signal the
topological phase transition. By analyzing the full energy spectrum, we
distinguish the true ground state from metastable excited states that emerge
past the critical point. Our results establish the Creutz-Hubbard ladder as a
minimal model for studying interaction-induced topological phenomena and
suggest a potential route for controlling magnetic, topological, and geometric
properties via electronic correlations.

Abstract: In one-dimensional p-wave superconductors with short-range interactions,
topologically protected Majorana modes emerge, whose mass decays exponentially
with system size, as first shown by Kitaev. In this work, we extend this
prototypical model by including power law long-range interactions within a
self-consistent framework, leading to the self-consistent long-range Kitaev
chain (seco-LRKC). In this model, the gap matrix acquires a rich structure
where short-range superconducting correlations coexist with long-range
correlations that are exponentially localized at both chain edges
simultaneously. As a direct consequence, the topological edge modes hybridize
even if their wavefunction overlap vanishes, and the edge mode mass inherits
the asymptotic scaling of the interaction. In contrast to models with imposed
power law pairing, where massive Dirac modes emerge for exponents $\nu < d$, we
analytically motivate and numerically demonstrate that, in the fully
self-consistent model, algebraic edge mode decay with system size persists for
all interaction exponents $\nu > 0$, despite exponential wave function
localization. While the edge mode remains massless in the thermodynamic limit,
finite-size corrections can be experimentally relevant in mesoscopic systems
with effective long-range interactions that decay sufficiently slowly.

also no compelling evidence of a QSL ground state due to significant structural

Abstract: Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated
collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are
related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear
altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number
of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform
magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band
filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining
phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge
density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide
parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and
altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of
spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split
fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We
discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.

Abstract: A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous
transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts
pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to
external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward
as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum
critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely
unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum
critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of
superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the
transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is
accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a
particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state,
and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies
photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological
performance.
