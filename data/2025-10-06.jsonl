For the induced spin\npolarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling\n(EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein\neffect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that\nmoderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via\nboth intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the\nonset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition\narises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split\nbands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete\ncollapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the\nRashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of\naltermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry\nbetween spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling,\nrendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications.

The depolarization transition\narises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split\nbands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete\ncollapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the\nRashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of\naltermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry\nbetween spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling,\nrendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further\ninvestigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba\nspin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization\ntransition. Our findings demonstrate that phonon scattering (e.g., through\nvarious substrates) offers a powerful means for on-demand control of spin\npolarization, enabling reversible switching between spin-polarized and\ndepolarized states -- a key functionality for advancing spin logic\narchitectures and optimizing next-generation spintronic devices."}

Here, we demonstrate that\npolycrystalline multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes with negative\neffective electron affinity (NEA) have MTE values at room temperature by a\nfactor of 2 lower than those of monocrystalline \\textit{p}-GaAs(Cs,O)\nphotocathodes. These low MTE values are due to the electron refraction on the\njump in mass, between a small effective mass in Na$_{2}$KSb and free electron\nmass in vacuum. It is proved that, at the NEA state, up to half of\nphotoelectrons are emitted in a narrow-angle cone with the fractional MTE of\n9\\,meV at room temperature. We also showed that the transition from NEA to\npositive effective affinity results in the subthermal total MTE of the\nNa$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathode, along with quantum efficiency of about\n10$^{-2}$. The physical reasons for the manifestation of the refraction effect\nin multialkali photocathodes are discussed, opening up opportunities for the\ndevelopment of high-brightness and ultracold robust electron sources."}

However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to\nconceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly\ncorrelate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the\nrelationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can\narise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the\nrotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group.\n% In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical\nactivity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic\nstructural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$)\nto low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition,\ndriven by the condensation of a zone-center $\\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses\nthe screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of\nthe optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and\nthe optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic\norigin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is\ndetermined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space\ngroup symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of\nthe structure."}
