We present a baseline fit within the forthcoming full CT25 fit, which includes new Drell-Yan, top-pair, and inclusive-jet data at 8 and 13 TeV, and exhibits non-trivial pulls on the high-$x$ gluon and the flavor structure of the quark sea. In the context of progress toward CT25, we also summarize several recent and ongoing studies of the interplay between phenomenological PDFs and lattice-QCD calculations, simultaneous extractions of $α_s(M_Z)$ within the CT framework, and an expanded program of uncertainty quantification that treats parametrization dependence as an explicit source of epistemic uncertainty, among other issues. We also briefly highlight CT efforts to understand the effects of partial implementations of N$^3$LO corrections into PDF fits, which include benchmark calculations for Higgs and vector-boson processes. We comment on the implications of recent improvements to the CT analysis for precision phenomenology at the LHC and future facilities."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "After the electroweak symmetry breaking, we can write down two types of mass for the Standard Model neutrinos, Dirac or Majorana. It is often said that both types of mass cannot be distinguished in neutrino oscillation phenomena. This is in fact not true if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac (strictly speaking still Majorana) where they mix almost maximally with sterile neutrinos to form pseudo-Dirac pairs. If this is indeed realized in Nature, what we observe experimentally as three mass eigenstates are actually three pairs of mass eigenstates with yet-to-be-measured new mass splitting among each pair. While the new mass squared splitting of the first and second mass eigenstates have stringent constraints from solar neutrino to be $|δm_{1,2}^2| \\lesssim10^{-11}\\,\\textrm{eV}^{2}$, the one regarding the third mass eigenstate has a weaker constraint $|δm_3^2| \\lesssim10^{-5}\\,\\textrm{eV}^{2}$. By keeping only one nonzero pseudo-Dirac mass squared splitting at a time, we derive an effective 3+1 description for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. Then we use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint on neutrino relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\\textrm{eff}}$ to derive a new constraint $|δm_3^2| < 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,{\\rm eV}^2$ and show that the future CMB-S4 and CMB-HD can improve this bound by an order of magnitude."}

By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials."}

Specifically in Josephson arrays with comparable Josephson and charging energies ($E_J\\sim E_C$), disorder tends to change the nature of the paradigmatic Superconductor-Insulator Transition (SIT) and potentially leads to formation of multiple distinct phases. We address this problem in a model of a two-legged Josephson ladder subjected to a wide spatial distribution of its parameters along the legs. In contrast, we assume the system to have a perfect $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to interchange between the legs, and investigate the effects of spatial randomness which preserves this symmetry in the strong-disorder limit. To this end, we apply a strong randomness real-space renormalization group technique and explore the resulting phase diagram. We identify three disorder-dominated phases, including an intermediate phase between a disordered superconductor and a disordered insulator. The latter insulating phase can be mapped to a XY spin-chain in a spin glass phase, while the intermediate phase turns out to be a Bose glass."}

Designed to leverage quantitative techniques for enhanced risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies in volatile environments, the architecture employs FinBERT, a transformer-based NLP model, to extract sentiment from ESG texts, followed by unsupervised clustering (UMAP/HDBSCAN) to identify 5 latent ESG regimes, validated via PCA. These regimes are mapped to economic conditions using a dense neural network and gradient boosting classifier, achieving 84.04% training and 82.0% validation accuracy. Concurrently, time-series models (SRNN, MLP, LSTM, GRU) forecast daily closing prices, with GRU attaining an R-squared of 0.801 and LSTM delivering 52.78% directional accuracy on intraday data. A strong correlation between S&P SL20 and S&P 500, observed through moving average and volatility trend plots, further bolsters forecasting precision. A rule-based fusion logic merges ESG and time-series outputs for final market signals. By addressing literature gaps that overlook emerging markets and holistic integration, this quant-driven framework combines global correlations and local sentiment analysis to offer scalable, accurate tools for quantitative finance professionals navigating complex markets like Sri Lanka."}

In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\\sim}250\\,μ$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries."}

It was originally developed for the CASCADE detector. The purpose of this simulation program is to provide a fast computational workflow and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for small to medium-sized projects. It features a ray-casting algorithm based on a voxel engine. The simulation domain is defined layerwise, whereas the geometry is extruded from a pixel matrix of materials, identified by specific numbers. Input files are a stack of pictures, all other settings, including the configuration of predefined sources, can be adjusted via the GUI. The scattering kernel features the treatment of elastic and inelastic collisions, absorption and absorption-like processes like evaporation. Cross sections, energy distributions and angular distributions are taken from evaluated data bases. In order to simulate boron-lined detectors it also models the charged particle transport following the conversion by computing the energy loss in the boron and its consecutive layer. The electron track is then projected onto a readout unit by longitudinal and transversal diffusion. URANOS is freely available and can be used to simulate the response function of boron-lined or epithermal neutron detectors, small-scale laboratory setups and especially transport studies of cosmic-ray induced environmental neutrons. It offers an easy accessibility and comparably simple interface capable of handling complex geometries. URANOS therefore offers possibilities to understand and simulate the neutron environment at instruments, which would otherwise require extensive modeling and training on dedicated packages."}

Conversely, we show that these special scalar alignments are perturbed when additional Lagrangian operators (e.g. renormalizable, multi-flavon operators and/or effective, higher-dimensional operators) are present that break said residual symmetry, leading to a vacuum reorientation and phenomenological consequences. We therefore construct a one-to-one correspondence principle between broken residual symmetries and vacuum alignment corrections, providing a mechanism to identify (and correct) a subtle but persistent form of phenomenologically relevant fine-tuning embedded in -- but often ignored by -- most successful non-Abelian flavour models. We first establish this correspondence in a set of toy models based on the S4 permutation symmetry, and then apply the lessons learned to the more realistic A4 Altarelli-Feruglio and $Δ(27)$ Universal Texture Zero models."}

The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes.

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this \"too big to fail\" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect."}

These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials."}

Most continuum scale models fail to capture the true nature of thermodynamic property variation across the interface, particularly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. An improvement over the sharp interface assumption of such continuum scale models is the consideration of a diffused interface and using Kinetic Boundary Conditions (KBCs) to model the mass-transport across the liquid vapor interface. Prior studies on KBCs mainly address monoatomic fluids. Two of the main ingredients required to form KBCs are: density and mass flux. Here, we study a Type-III binary mixture of n-dodecane and nitrogen using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at near-critical temperatures. Interfacial properties such as thickness, density gradient, and surface tension were analyzed. A key result is the temporal evolution of the evaporation and reflected mass fluxes across the vapor-liquid interface. We observe that both the evaporation and reflection fluxes increase with increasing temperature, indicating enhanced molecular activity and mass transport across the interface at higher Tr. In contrast, the evaporation coefficient alpha_evap decreases from about alpha approximately 0.978 at Tr equals 0.70 to alpha approximately 0.905 at Tr equals 0.95 because the reflected-out flux increases along with the evaporation flux, which reduces the net efficiency of molecular evaporation across the interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the very few studies estimating mass transport coefficients for Type-III binary systems, laying the foundation for KBCs in hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures."}

This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes."}

Recent geometric approaches based on conic hulls and triangulations provide a systematic framework for computing multiple MB integrals in terms of multivariate series. These approaches have so far been limited to MB integrals whose integrands are ratios of products of Euler's gamma functions only. However, in Feynman integral calculus, MB integrals with polygamma functions naturally arise, for instance, after resolving singularities in the dimensional-regularisation parameter $ε$ and expanding the MB integrand in powers of $ε$, as done by the public codes MB.m and MBresolve.m. In this paper, we extend the conic hull and triangulation methods to the computation of MB integrals having polygamma functions in their integrand. We show that the arguments of polygamma functions can be treated in a similar way to the arguments of gamma functions when applying the conic hull and triangulation techniques to identify poles that would contribute to different series solutions. However, since the singularity structure of the polygamma function is different from that of the gamma function, we propose two different ways to compute MB integrals involving polygamma functions, depending on whether the MB integral has straight or non-straight contours. We have implemented these algorithms in an updated version of the Mathematica package MBConicHulls.wl, which can be found at https://github.com/SumitBanikGit/MBConicHulls/, and we illustrate their use with a set of examples from Feynman integral calculus."}

The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors."}

The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i>1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \\approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \\approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT.

However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \\emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics."}

The angle dependence of Raman intensity under linear polarization configuration exhibits a strong tilt in the laboratory coordinate, indicating the existence of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling. The electron-phonon coupling was also examined via the Fano parameter of the asymmetric peak in the Raman spectra.

Unlike conventional analyses, we do not use the decays of the neutrino embedded in the right-chiral lepton doublet, but rather those of the gauge-singlet mediators required for neutrino mass generation in the canonical Type-I seesaw. Due to the generalized parity symmetry that doubles the fermionic degrees of freedom in this model, we can generate the required $CP$ violation in the heavy fermion decays with only a single generation of mediators. One of the distinct features of our scenario is that the bounds from thermalization or washout via gauge interactions typically encountered in the canonical left-right symmetric models do not apply here. Moreover, the heavy mediators can decay to both the left and the right-chiral neutrinos, leading to a cancellation in the resulting baryon asymmetry for decays above the left-right symmetry breaking scale. We discuss ways to avoid this cancellation and show that low scale left-right symmetry breaking above the current collider limits is viable. The right chiral neutrinos also obtain their masses from the seesaw mechanism, and the lightest one turns out to have a sub-eV scale mass. We find that its abundance is consistent with standard cosmology, and it acts as potentially observable dark radiation."}

In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner approximation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse."}

A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $μ$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK."}

Another consequence is the suppression of energetic particles in the jet which has been observed already for c- and b-quark jets. The suppression of the forward particles can be explained by an application of the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of perturbative QCD. In this paper we investigate whether this type of analysis can be carried out also for top-quark jets with the much higher heavy quark mass allowing for QCD tests in this new kinematic regime. The new aspect of this analysis is the finite lifetime of the top quark. We consider for simplicity the decay $t\\to b\\ellν$, where the b-quark radiates gluons as well and partially obscures the dead cone. Guided by the decay amplitude in leading order in $α_s$ we propose a method to separate the radiation by the $\\widehat{tb}$ dipole in the decay process which is superimposed to the primary radiation from the $\\widehat{t \\bar t}$ dipole involving the top-quark dead cone effect. The momentum distributions of partons or charged particles are determined for finite decay angles of the b-quark $Θ_b$ and extrapolated into forward direction $Θ_b=0$ where the radiation from the decay process is expected to vanish.

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing."}

The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries.

However, most state-of-the-art FETs based on monolayer MoS2 channel operate in depletion mode with negative Vth due to doping from the underlying dielectric substrate. In this work, we identify key properties of the semiconductor/dielectric interface (MoS2 on industrially relevant high dielectric constant (k) HfO2, ZrO2 and hBN for reference) responsible for realizing enhancement-mode operation of 2D MoS2 channel FETs. We find that hBN and ZrO2 dielectric substrates provide low defect interfaces with MoS2 that enables effective modulation of the Vth using gate metals of different work functions (WFs). We use photoluminescence (PL) and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate doping levels in monolayer MoS2 on different dielectrics with different WF gate metals. We complement the FET and spectroscopic measurements with capacitance-voltage analysis on dielectrics with varying thicknesses, which confirm that Vth modulation in ZrO2 devices is correlated with WF of the gate metals - in contrast with HfO2 devices that exhibit signatures of Vth pinning induced by oxide/interface defect states. Finally, we demonstrate FETs using a 2D MoS2 channel and a 6 nm of ZrO2 dielectric, achieving a subthreshold swing of 87 mV dec-1 and a threshold voltage of 0.1 V.

In this study, we demonstrate that such behavior can also arise in a single-network superconducting system that features two distinct types of interactions: short-range electrical connectivity and long-range thermal dependency. Using experimental and simulation methods, we show that when sufficient heat is dissipated within a single-layer disordered superconducting network, the system undergoes a mixed-order phase transition marked by both a discontinuous change in resistance and critical scaling behavior. We find that the emergence and characteristics of these abrupt transitions depend critically on the thermal conductivity of the underlying substrate, establishing heat flow as the origin of the unique phase transition. Additionally, both experimental and numerical results reveal long-lived transient states and scaling dynamics near the critical point, consistent with spontaneous branching processes observed in interdependent networks theory. These findings strongly demonstrate that complex critical phenomena, such as mixed-order transitions, previously attributed to structurally interdependent systems, can also arise within single-layer physical systems when dual interactions coexist. Our results broaden the scope of the theory and experiments of phase transitions in interdependent networks and suggest new ways to design and control phase changes in physical, biological, and technological systems where two interactions are present."}

An Examination on the Effect of Higher Diligence Calculations of the Sound Shell Model", "comment": "34 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "The gravitational wave spectrum arising from using the full velocity profile is well known to differ qualitatively from analytic fits to a broken power law. Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $ακ$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak. All this implies that the spectrum is sensitive to five thermal parameters rather than four which gives hope that an observation of a gravitational wave spectrum from a first order cosmological phase transition could eventually give even more information about the underlying microphysics responsible."}

The first BSM scenario involves a flavon FOPT in two ultraviolet-complete models of the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism. In both models, for the FN symmetry-breaking scale $v_s = 10^{4-7}\\,$GeV, the parameter space is constrained by GWs in upcoming observatories such as BBO, DECIGO, CE, and ET.

The techniques of this thesis can be applied to other BSM scenarios in the future."}

All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder yet yields the highest TC, indicating that in the Ti40V60 alloys, moderate disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the V under-layer and pristine films without under-layer, along with a coherence length (~6.2 nm) much smaller than the film thickness (25 nm), confirms the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films."}

Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism."}

It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene."}

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations combined with a state-of-the-art annealing protocol, we systematically investigate these behaviors in a model metallic glass across effective quenching rates spanning six orders of magnitude. Through a double-notch model, we show that the normalized interaction distance relative to the single shear band width is significantly larger in slowly quenched samples than in rapidly quenched ones. Atomic-scale analysis reveals that rapidly quenched samples exhibit a high density of pre-existing soft regions, which trigger correlated shear transformation zones through local vortex fields, resulting in propagation path locking and weak inter-band coupling. In contrast, slowly quenched samples exhibit enhanced structural heterogeneity and a right-shifted activation energy spectrum, promoting a single large-scale vortex field ahead of the shear band front. This field facilitates long-range stress transmission and induces shear band deflection, convergence, and coalescence, a transition resembling a \"shielding effect\" in fracture mechanics, where vortex-mediated disturbances destabilize the advancing shear band front. Our findings establish a direct microscopic connection between glass stability and shear-band-mediated plasticity and suggest that regulating shear band interactions offers a promising route to enhance the room-temperature ductility of metallic glasses."}

The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors."}

It consists of 64 pages and 11 figures", "summary": "In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe existed in an extremely hot, dense state in which particle interactions occurred not in a vacuum but within a thermal medium. Under such conditions, the standard framework of quantum field theory (QFT) requires a finite temperature extension, wherein propagators -- and hence the fundamental structure of the theory -- are modified to reflect thermal background effects. These thermal modifications are central to understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as a high temperature phase transition, potentially leading to qualitatively different vacuum structures for the Higgs field as the universe cooled. Finite temperature corrections naturally regulate ultraviolet divergences in propagators, hinting at a possible route toward ultraviolet completion. However, these same thermal effects exacerbate infrared pathologies and can lead to imaginary contributions to the effective potential, particularly when analysing metastable or multi-vacuum configurations. Additional theoretical challenges, such as gauge dependence and renormalization scale ambiguity, further obscure the precise characterization of the electroweak phase transition even in minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM). This review presents the theoretical foundations of finite temperature QFT with an emphasis on how different field species respond to thermal effects, identifying the bosonic sector as the primary source of key theoretical subtleties. We focus particularly on the scalar extension of the SM, which offers a compelling framework for realizing first order electroweak phase transitions, electroweak baryogenesis, and accommodating dark matter candidates depending on the underlying $Z_2$ symmetry structure."}

We focus mainly on a class of models known as the gamma-model, which generalizes the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity where the effective interaction potential scales as V(Omega) ~ 1/|Omega|^gamma. Building on a recent reformulation of Migdal-Eliashberg theory, expressed as a classical infinite spin chain with nonlocal interactions, and employing a simple linear algebra framework, we derive rigorous closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the superconducting transition temperature for any gamma > 0. While our lower bounds coincide precisely with those previously in the literature, our derivation offers a more streamlined and accessible method. Moreover, our upper bounds are substantially tighter than any existing estimates and converge rapidly enough to the numerical results from various prior studies."}

Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs.

In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups.

We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides.\n  In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers.\n  In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates."}

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles.

We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance.

A 0.2 mm anodized aluminium foil serves as the flexible substrate, where localized laser ablation exposes metallic aluminium regions that act as reductive sites, effectively suppressing Sn2+ oxidation during nanowire growth. Simultaneously, a polar interlayer of 3-fluoro-2-nitroanisole is introduced to improve energy-level alignment, suppress interfacial deprotonation, and enhance charge extraction.

Moreover, the device retains over 85% of its initial photocurrent after 60 days in ambient air and maintains 94% of its initial photocurrent after 1000 bending cycles.

Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter."}

Total of 6 Figures in the main manuscript and 10 on the supplementary", "summary": "Hyperbolic metamaterials enable extreme light confinement and control of photonic states, but their realization has been restricted to inorganic architectures. Here, a fully organic route to fabricate artificial hyperbolic metamaterials based on multilayered thin films of J-aggregate carbocyanine dyes alternated with polyelectrolytes is introduced. These structures exhibit strong optical anisotropy and experimentally support hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons and, for selected dyes, additional surface waves in near-zero permittivity regimes. Spectroscopic ellipsometry confirms a uniaxial dielectric tensor with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane components, close to the absorption peaks of the constituent J-aggregates. This anisotropy is preserved across individual layers, demonstrating the robustness of the layer-by-layer approach and enabling the coupling of surface exciton polaritons and near-zero permittivity modes even in films only a few nanometres thick. Transfer-matrix simulations based on the obtained dielectric tensor reproduce the coupling conditions for all thicknesses, validating the optical model. Structural characterization reveals the link between optical anisotropy and supramolecular order, with preferential in-plane molecular orientation and the evolution from discrete nanostructures to continuous films as deposition progresses. These organic hyperbolic metamaterial architectures, associated with narrow excitonic resonances from J-aggregates, offer a unique platform for tailoring emission, energy transport, and exploring polariton dynamics at the nanoscale."}

Astrophysical, cosmological, and laboratory constraints require axions to be extremely weakly coupled to Standard Model particles, making them viable dark matter candidates .This PhD thesis presents original results developed over three years of research, focusing on axion cosmology and axion electrodynamics. These topics address the production of axions and their associated topological defects in the early Universe, as well as the interactions of axions with Standard Model particles. The analysis combines methods from non-equilibrium quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. After reviewing the foundations of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and cosmology, the thesis introduces the Strong CP problem and the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, including the PQWW axion model and its invisible extensions. Ultraviolet completions of QCD axion theories are discussed in both field-theoretic and extra-dimensional frameworks. A significant part of the thesis is devoted to axion electrodynamics, where a classical axion background modifies Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic observables. The non-equilibrium dynamics of self-interacting axion fields coupled to the Standard Model or to a dark sector are also studied using the two-particle-irreducible effective action, and applied to pre- and post-inflationary cosmological scenarios, yielding new insights and preliminary constraints."}

Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism."}

However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \\emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics."}

We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides.\n  In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers.\n  In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates."}

It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene."}

We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides.\n  In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers.\n  In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates."}
