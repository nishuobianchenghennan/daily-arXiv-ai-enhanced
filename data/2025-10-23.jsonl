We study the prospects for\ndetecting axions through this method and identify two key characteristics that\nresult in compelling detection sensitivity. First, the gradient of the\ngenerated axion field can be substantial, set by the inverse distance from the\nsource. In the near zone, it reduces to the inverse of the source's geometric\nsize. Second, because the generated axion field is produced at a known\nfrequency, the detection medium can be tuned precisely to this frequency,\nenabling long interrogation times. We show that the experimental sensitivity of\na pair of centimeter-scale NMR devices operating over a 15-day integration time\ncan already surpass existing astrophysical bounds on the axion-nucleon\ncoupling.

The obtained predictions\nare compared with previously measured ALICE data at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV as a function of the cube root of the average\nparticle multiplicity density at midrapidity, showing that both radii and\nemission asymmetries scale with particle multiplicity, regardless of the\ncollision energy.

Additionally, CMS has observed an excess in\nthe $\\gamma\\gamma b\\bar{b}$ final state, indicating a possible resonance near\n650 GeV decaying into a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons or into a SM-like Higgs\nboson accompanied by a lighter scalar with mass near 95 GeV. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether these anomalies can be simultaneously explained within the\nNext-to-2-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM), an extension of the Standard Model (SM)\nscalar sector featuring two complex Higgs doublets and an additional real\nsinglet. Assuming the existence of a CP-even Higgs state compatible with the 95\nGeV excesses (restricted to the $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $b\\bar b$ channels), we\nanalyse the Type-II and Type-Y Yukawa structures, taking the observed 650 GeV\nresonance to be a CP-even Higgs state. An extensive parameter scan is\nperformed, incorporating the latest constraints. Our results show that a heavy\nCP-even Higgs resonance around 650 GeV, produced predominantly via gluon-gluon\nfusion and subsequently decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson together with\nanother scalar at approximately 95 GeV, can be simultaneously accommodated\nwithin both the N2HDM Type-II and Type-Y frameworks at a significance level of\n2$\\sigma$.
