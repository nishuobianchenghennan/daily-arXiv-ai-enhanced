We present DMK-MC, an accelerated MC method that adapts the dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting (DMK) framework to single-particle Metropolis updates. DMK-MC computes the energy change and, upon acceptance, updates the stored incoming plane-wave fields with $O(1)$ work per tree level, yielding an overall $O(\\log N)$ expected work per trial move for fixed accuracy. The method decomposes the Coulomb kernel into three components: a global, periodized smooth part; a multilevel sequence of smooth difference kernels whose interactions are restricted to same-level colleague boxes; and a singular residual kernel whose short-range interactions are evaluated directly. Benchmarks on uniform, highly nonuniform, and implicit-solvent electrolyte and colloidal configurations show that DMK-MC consistently outperforms a recent FMM-based $O(\\log N)$ Monte Carlo method, delivering several-fold speedups at comparable tolerances."}

While the twisted DW generates an effective gauge field for spin waves, leading to a deflection of their trajectories, our main focus is on a distinct effect that arises when a hard-axis anisotropy is present in addition to the easy-axis anisotropy. In this case, the translational symmetry of the spin-wave Hamiltonian along the DW is broken, resulting in a periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian. This periodicity leads to the formation of multiple diffracted spin wave modes on both sides of the DW, engendering a DW-induced magnonic diffraction pattern. The interplay between the emergent gauge field and the anisotropy-induced periodicity reveals rich spin-wave dynamics and suggests potential applications for manipulating magnon flow in two-dimensional magnetic textures."}

We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to \"local\" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants."}

They can absorb hydrogen gas reversibly at near ambient temperatures and practical pressures with high volumetric capacities surpassing that of cryogenically liquified H2. The main drawback of TiFe-based storage systems is a costly activation procedure required due to the formation of oxide surface layer, which hinders hydrogen diffusion into the bulk. Doping the alloy with various additives is known to improve hydrogen diffusion softening the conditions of the activation procedure. Hydrogen sorption properties of the modified alloys have been the focus of most studies whereas less attention has been dedicated to the fundamental understanding of the effects of hydrogen sorption on the alloys' structure. The latter, however, is an important information in the knowledge-guided design of novel materials. In this work, we investigated effects of Nb-doping on crystallographic structure of TiFe metal-alloy compounds and their hydrogen sorption properties. TiFe samples with two different Nb stoichiometries were synthesized using arc-melting (AM) and characterised with synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. Overall, H2 absorption measurements (at 50 +/- 2 degrees C and 40 +/- 2 bar), have shown that doping of TiFe with Nb can improve matrix activation and kinetics of hydrogen sorption without compromising the overall storage capacities. Refinement of SR-PXRD and EXAFS data showed significant Nb occupancy in secondary Ti phases, which improved the hydrogenation properties of the alloys."}

We reveal that: (i) the PL originates from genuinely hybridized direct-indirect excitonic eigenstates, rather than nominally mixed species with fixed dominant character; (ii) the direct exciton converts into the indirect one via a previously unrecognized two-step pathway -- exchange-interaction-driven exciton transfer followed by a spin flip; and (iii) a higher-energy indirect exciton, absent from prior studies, acts as a crucial intermediate mediating this conversion. Beyond explaining experiment, our theory predicts a striking strain-driven \"sinusoidal'' valley response, furnishing a continuously tunable valley dial that far exceeds binary control schemes. This unified picture of strain-engineered direct-indirect exciton dynamics introduces a new paradigm for manipulating long-lived valley degrees of freedom, opening a pathway toward programmable valley pseudospin engineering and next-generation valleytronic quantum technologies."}

Here, we introduce a machine-learning-assisted, high-throughput framework for creep law identification based on a dimple array bulge instrument (DABI) configuration, which enables parallel creep testing of 25 dimples, each fabricated from a different alloy, in a single experiment. Full-field surface displacements of dimples undergoing time-dependent creep-induced bulging under inert gas pressure are measured by 3D digital image correlation. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a surrogate model, mapping creep parameters and loading conditions to the time-dependent deformation response of DABI. Coupling this surrogate with a particle swarm optimization scheme enables rapid and global inverse identification with sparsity regularization of creep parameters from experiment displacement-time histories. In addition, we propose a phenomenological creep law with a time-dependent stress exponent that captures the sigmoidal primary creep observed in wrought INCONEL 625 and extracts its temperature dependence from DABI test at multiple temperatures. Furthermore, we employ a general creep law combining several conventional forms together with regularized inversion to identify the creep laws for 47 additional Fe-, Ni-, and Co-rich alloys and to automatically select the dominant functional form for each alloy. This workflow combined with DABI experiment provides a quantitative, high-throughput creep characterization platform that is compatible with data mining, composition-property modeling, and nonlinear structural optimization with creep behavior across a large alloy design space."}

However, the realization of high-performance functional nanostructures presents formidable challenges due to the difficulty of applying conventional nanofabrication methods to such sensitive materials, making the search for alternative methods a key enabling factor. Since YBCO's superconducting and normal-state properties are highly dependent on oxygen stoichiometry, precise nanoscale control of the oxygen content represents a highly appealing approach for creating advanced nanoengineered devices. In this work, we demonstrate the precise fabrication of sub-micrometer, grayscale patterns over large areas in epitaxial YBCO thin films, achieving finely tuned optical and superconducting transport properties by locally controlling the stoichiometry through maskless direct laser writing under ambient conditions. Cryogenic magneto-optical imaging and transport measurements in irradiated devices directly demonstrate the spatial tuning of the critical temperature and carrier density with the patterning conditions. Correlated Raman microscopy and reflectometry of the patterned regions indicate a laser-power dependent oxygen depletion in the irradiated regions. The proposed laser-controlled stoichiometry approach provides a direct and scalable method to navigate the phase diagram of high-Tc superconducting oxides, offering new possibilities for integrating functional nanostructures into superconducting devices."}

Our results show that appropriately chosen ultrathin BLs can prevent interfacial alterations from ferromagnetic metals, facilitating efficient spin detection in graphene and enhancing control over spin angular momentum dissipation in graphene/FM interfaces."}

In the dark, the intrinsic magnetism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is shown to yield a stronger anisotropic RKKY spin model compared to nonmagnetic topological insulators, providing a clear signature for differentiating these systems. Furthermore, key band properties -- such as energy gap, band degeneracy/splitting, and topological deformations of the Fermi surface -- imprint distinct signatures on the RKKY interaction, enabling clear discrimination between even- and odd-septuple-layer (SL) films. This discrimination manifests in multiple ways: through the Fermi-energy dependence or spatial oscillations of the interaction for impurities on the same surface, or via the presence versus absence of spin-frustrated terms for those on different surfaces. Under off-resonant circularly polarized light, we track photoinduced topological phase transitions and identify two characteristic signatures at the phase boundary: a sign reversal in spin-frustrated terms and a dip in collinear RKKY components. These serve as fingerprints for circular-polarization-chirality-dependent topological transitions in even- and odd-SL films, respectively. Overall, this work establishes RKKY interactions as a sensitive magnetic probe for revealing both distinctive band properties and light-driven phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, thereby complementing conventional electrical measurements while providing new insights into the influence of intrinsic magnetism on the surface-state band structure."}

Motivated by recent experimental observations of broken helix magnetic structures in EuIn$_2$As$_2$, we focus on the microscopic interaction conditions in stabilizing such multiple-$Q$ states.We employ two effective spin models: One is the momentum-space-based model, and the other is the real-space-based model, both of which include bilinear and biquadratic easy-plane anisotropic interactions. By analyzing their ground state via simulated annealing, we find that a superposition of a spiral and a staggered modulation yields a robust double-$Q$ magnetic structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained double-$Q$ spin configuration exhibits an antisymmetric spin-split band structure even without the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and further reveals asymmetric band modulations when the magnetic field is applied along the out-of-plane direction.

P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($ρ$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($μ_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $μ_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties.

In this work, we propose a concrete neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter (''light WIMPs'') based on an additional gauge symmetry $\\mathrm{U}(1)_{\\mathrm{B}-\\mathrm{L}+x\\mathrm{Y}}$; for an appropriate choice of $x$, the new gauge boson couples predominantly to dark matter and neutrinos while its couplings to charged leptons are suppressed, so that sub-GeV dark matter annihilates almost exclusively into neutrinos, with hadronic modes kinematically closed. We map the parameter space in which the observed relic abundance is reproduced via standard thermal freeze-out in a conventional cosmological history, and show that sizable regions remain viable after imposing current cosmological, indirect-detection, and terrestrial constraints; in part of the allowed parameter space, the dark matter also exhibits sufficiently large self-interactions to potentially alleviate small-scale structure tensions."}

This 2D ancestor model relates the role of the external magnetic flux in the Hall problem and that of a geometric flux which describes the winding of the quasicrystal in 2D, in the cut-and-project method. Doing this enables us to extend the notion of Chern numbers as defined in 2D, to the energy bands of the 1D chain by adiabatic continuity. The older notion of gap labels in the 1D system are now seen to be derivable from the Chern numbers of the 2D bands. The Fibonacci-Hall model thus provides an important link between physics of two paradigmatic models, the Fibonacci quasicrystal and the quantum Hall insulator.

Here, we present a scalable computational framework that combines machine learning interatomic potentials, anharmonic lattice dynamics, and high-throughput calculations to investigate temperature-dependent phonons across thousands of materials. By fine-tuning the universal M3GNet interatomic potential using high-quality phonon data, we improve phonon prediction accuracy by a factor of four while preserving computational efficiency. Integrating this refined model into a high-throughput implementation of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we compute temperature-dependent phonons for 4,669 inorganic compounds. Our analysis identifies systematic elemental and structural trends governing anharmonic phonon renormalization, with particularly strong manifestations in alkali metals, perovskite-derived frameworks, and related systems. Machine learning models trained on this dataset identify key atomic-scale features driving strong anharmonicity, including weak bonding, large atomic radii, and specific coordination motifs. First-principles validation confirms that anharmonic effects can dramatically alter lattice thermal conductivity by factors of two to four in some materials.

Yet, it remains unclear what mechanism drives the temperature dependence of $ρ(T)$ beyond $ρ_{\\rm FL}$.

From the NMR relaxation rate, we can identify the gradual crossover between the QP-dominated regime at low $T$ to predominant local moments at higher $T$.

Near the Mott insulator, where $dρ/dT<0$ at high $T$, an Einstein-relation analysis shows that bad-metal behavior with $dρ/dT>0$ is driven by the temperature dependence of the electronic compressibility rather than the diffusion constant."}

The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching.

The microscopic origin of the emergent local electronic properties is often debated, however, as quantitative atomic-scale characterization remains challenging. A prime example is enhanced conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls, attributed to mechanisms ranging from local band gap reduction to point defect accumulations. Here, we resolve the microscopic mechanisms for domain wall conduction in the ferroelectric model system BiFeO3, by combining transport measurements with atom probe tomography to quantify the local chemical composition and correlate it with the electrical properties. Significant chemical variations along the walls are observed, demonstrating an outstanding chemical flexibility at domain walls, which manifest in spatially varying physical properties. The results give a unifying explanation for the diverse electronic behavior observed and establish the fundamental notion that multiple conduction mechanisms can coexist within individual domain walls."}

Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \\textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $ρ$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \\textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour."}

We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit.

However, in application-relevant polycrystalline materials exhibiting a distribution of grain orientations, a direct mapping of the polarization direction in three dimensions has remained inaccessible using conventional experimental approaches. Here, taking barium titanate single crystals and lead zirconium titanate polycrystals as our bulk model systems, we map the local polarization directions using a new electron backscatter diffraction indexing technique based on simulated pattern-matching. Through improved pre-processing techniques (including optimized pattern processing, a new pseudosymmetry-sensitive neighbor pattern averaging method, and DIC-based global sample-detector geometry calibration) and a new pseudosymmetry confidence index (which considers not only pattern similarity but pattern dissimilarity trends with other domain variant patterns), we successfully distinguish between the six polarization directions, despite the challengingly small unit cell aspect ratio of the selected materials.

This 2D ancestor model relates the role of the external magnetic flux in the Hall problem and that of a geometric flux which describes the winding of the quasicrystal in 2D, in the cut-and-project method. Doing this enables us to extend the notion of Chern numbers as defined in 2D, to the energy bands of the 1D chain by adiabatic continuity. The older notion of gap labels in the 1D system are now seen to be derivable from the Chern numbers of the 2D bands. The Fibonacci-Hall model thus provides an important link between physics of two paradigmatic models, the Fibonacci quasicrystal and the quantum Hall insulator. The generalization to other 1D quasiperiodic models is expected to be relatively straightforward. The extension to 2D cut-and-project tilings is left for future studies."}

We demonstrate that neglecting $R_S$ in modern studies, especially for topological materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, can lead to doubtful conclusions. Through theoretical analysis and numerical examples, we show how the interplay between the Berry phase and Zeeman effect complicates phase determination. Additionally, we also discuss another underappreciated mechanism - the magnetic field dependence of the Fermi level. Our discussion underscores the need for complementary experimental techniques to resolve these ambiguities and calls for further research to refine the interpretation of quantum oscillations in topological systems."}

Understanding the local polarization switching behavior, through domain nucleation and evolution, is critical to advancing these technologies and requires characterization of the local domain microstructure. However, in application-relevant polycrystalline materials exhibiting a distribution of grain orientations, a direct mapping of the polarization direction in three dimensions has remained inaccessible using conventional experimental approaches. Here, taking barium titanate single crystals and lead zirconium titanate polycrystals as our bulk model systems, we map the local polarization directions using a new electron backscatter diffraction indexing technique based on simulated pattern-matching. Through improved pre-processing techniques (including optimized pattern processing, a new pseudosymmetry-sensitive neighbor pattern averaging method, and DIC-based global sample-detector geometry calibration) and a new pseudosymmetry confidence index (which considers not only pattern similarity but pattern dissimilarity trends with other domain variant patterns), we successfully distinguish between the six polarization directions, despite the challengingly small unit cell aspect ratio of the selected materials. The methods developed in this work are not only applicable to ferroelectrics but any material which exhibits close crystallographic pseudosymmetries--extending the current capabilities of EBSD."}

Extending the EB effect to three-dimensional (3D) architectures enables investigation of interfacial coupling in non-planar structures, which is a key step toward realizing spintronic functionalities beyond planar systems. Achieving this requires the fabrication of FM/AF bilayers with smooth interfaces and well-defined thicknesses on non-planar scaffolds, together with suitable characterization methods. In this work, we realize exchange-biased 3D FM/AF microwires by combining two-photon lithography with magnetron sputtering. CoFe/IrMn bilayers are deposited on microwire scaffolds with inclination angles of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg relative to the substrate, and their magnetization reversal is probed using dark-field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry. We find that the EB and coercive fields vary in a characteristic way with the inclination angle, consistent with the systematic reduction in film thickness expected from inclined directional deposition. In addition, the EB magnitude is influenced by the combined effects of surface roughness of non-planar geometries and the directional growth of the bilayer, highlighting the importance of 3D scaffold surface quality for integrating magnetic multilayers. These results provide insight into the growth and magnetic behavior of sputter-deposited magnetic multilayers with functional interfaces on 3D geometries."}

Growing evidence links ductility with their electronic structure. Consequently, it is desirable to understand how the electronic structure affects the elastic constants. Here, we examine the Ta-W binary alloy system, which evolves from ductile character at Ta-rich compositions to brittleness at high W. We show that a change in slope of the composition-dependent shear modulus near the equiatomic composition coincides with an abrupt change in the Fermi level density of states. We relate the behaviors of the elastic constants to the characters of occupied electronic orbitals close to the Fermi level. Finally, we consider additional alloy systems from groups V and VI and show that qualitatively similar behavior occurs more broadly."}

The low-energy electrodynamics is strongly anisotropic, with metallic in-plane and insulating out-of-plane character. In the ordered phase, the anisotropy grows more than an order of magnitude as the out-of-plane conductivity is sharply suppressed. We interpret this enhancement as an effective electronic decoupling of the Ni-O layers, driven by a spin-density-wave-induced redistribution of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ occupation within the trilayers. This electronic response is accompanied by clear shifts and splittings of the out-of-plane phonons, compatible with a density-wave instability of electronic origin."}

However, challenges such as the interfacial impedance mismatch, FM deposition-induced defect generation, and interface modification by interfacial coupling or hybridization can impede their functionalization for spin-orbitronics. In this work, we utilize insulating TiOx barrier layers (BLs) to modify the interfacial spin conductance structurally, disentangle spin pumping and magnetic proximity effects (MPE), and establish external control over ultrafast magnetization dynamics in single-layer graphene/TiOx/Co systems. All-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of femtosecond to nanosecond spin dynamics reveal systematic tunability of ultrafast magnetic parameters via barrier engineering. The thickness-dependent damping modulation in Co indicates strong spin pumping, with interfacial spin transparency close to half its physical limit in the presence of an ultrathin BL, where MPE is eliminated. Our results show that appropriately chosen ultrathin BLs can prevent interfacial alterations from ferromagnetic metals, facilitating efficient spin detection in graphene and enhancing control over spin angular momentum dissipation in graphene/FM interfaces."}

In the dark, the intrinsic magnetism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is shown to yield a stronger anisotropic RKKY spin model compared to nonmagnetic topological insulators, providing a clear signature for differentiating these systems. Furthermore, key band properties -- such as energy gap, band degeneracy/splitting, and topological deformations of the Fermi surface -- imprint distinct signatures on the RKKY interaction, enabling clear discrimination between even- and odd-septuple-layer (SL) films. This discrimination manifests in multiple ways: through the Fermi-energy dependence or spatial oscillations of the interaction for impurities on the same surface, or via the presence versus absence of spin-frustrated terms for those on different surfaces. Under off-resonant circularly polarized light, we track photoinduced topological phase transitions and identify two characteristic signatures at the phase boundary: a sign reversal in spin-frustrated terms and a dip in collinear RKKY components. These serve as fingerprints for circular-polarization-chirality-dependent topological transitions in even- and odd-SL films, respectively. Overall, this work establishes RKKY interactions as a sensitive magnetic probe for revealing both distinctive band properties and light-driven phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, thereby complementing conventional electrical measurements while providing new insights into the influence of intrinsic magnetism on the surface-state band structure."}

P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($ρ$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($μ_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $μ_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties. After effective interface engineering, low temperature electrical characterization revealed a significant increase in P ionization energy in samples with $H_{SOI}$ <= 15 nm, a result directly related to the dielectric mismatch."}

However, the realization of high-performance functional nanostructures presents formidable challenges due to the difficulty of applying conventional nanofabrication methods to such sensitive materials, making the search for alternative methods a key enabling factor. Since YBCO's superconducting and normal-state properties are highly dependent on oxygen stoichiometry, precise nanoscale control of the oxygen content represents a highly appealing approach for creating advanced nanoengineered devices. In this work, we demonstrate the precise fabrication of sub-micrometer, grayscale patterns over large areas in epitaxial YBCO thin films, achieving finely tuned optical and superconducting transport properties by locally controlling the stoichiometry through maskless direct laser writing under ambient conditions. Cryogenic magneto-optical imaging and transport measurements in irradiated devices directly demonstrate the spatial tuning of the critical temperature and carrier density with the patterning conditions. Correlated Raman microscopy and reflectometry of the patterned regions indicate a laser-power dependent oxygen depletion in the irradiated regions. The proposed laser-controlled stoichiometry approach provides a direct and scalable method to navigate the phase diagram of high-Tc superconducting oxides, offering new possibilities for integrating functional nanostructures into superconducting devices."}

The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching. Dissipation-driven phase transitions in large-area magnetic systems provide a solid-state platform to study magnonic analogs of relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling and black holes, as well as spin-wave amplification and lasing."}

Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \\textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $ρ$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \\textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour."}
