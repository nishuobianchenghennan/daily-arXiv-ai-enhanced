In this study, we investigate the migration mechanisms of H$^+$, Li$^+$, and Mg$^{2+}$ ions in monoclinic WO$_3$, and how energy barriers are affected by the presence of electron polarons and by lattice strain. Our approach in calculating the migration paths and barriers is based on density functional theory methods. The results show that the presence of polarons leads to association effects and lattice deformations that increase ion migration barriers. Therefore, the consideration of polarons is critical to accurately predict activation energies of ion migration. We further show that lattice strain modulates ion migration barriers, however, the impact of strain depends on the migrating ion. For protons that are embedded in the oxygen ion electronic shells and hop from donor to acceptor oxygens, compressive lattice strain accelerates migration by reducing the donor-acceptor distance. In contrast, the migration barriers of larger ions decrease with tensile lattice strain that increases the free space for the ion in the transition state. These insights into the effects of polarons and lattice strain are important for understanding and tuning properties of WO$_3$ when aiming for optimized device characteristics."}

In this work, we employ monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) to resolve band gap variations across $κ$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based multilayers with nanometer-scale precision. A custom automated quantitative-based EELS analysis framework enabled automated band gap fitting and visualization, ensuring reproducibility and high spatial resolution. By optimizing acquisition parameters and quantifying inelastic delocalization, we demonstrate reliable extraction of band gap excitations from layers only a few nanometers thick. For heterostructures grown on ITO templates, strain at defect-free interfaces induces a gradual band gap transition from $5.08~\\mathrm{eV}$ to $4.28~\\mathrm{eV}$ over $\\sim 10~\\mathrm{nm}$, despite an abrupt compositional change. In contrast, ZnO-based templates introduce structural defects that relieve strain, yielding band gaps consistent with composition. These results establish STEM-EELS as a powerful tool for nanoscale electronic characterization and highlight the dominant role of interfacial strain over composition in governing local band structure."}

To linear order and for insulators, the density follows the well-known Streda formula, but for metals there is an extra contribution from the orbital magnetic moments at the Fermi surface. To second order, we find that the average density depends on several microscopic processes. Among these, the quantum metric tensor plays an important role by generating a pseudo-magnetic moment resulting from the rotation of the Bloch wave functions in the complex projective plane. We also discuss the implications of our results for the volume and pressure. The method we develop is explicitly gauge invariant, considers intraband and interband processes on equal footing, accommodates relaxation processes, and can be readily extended to other observables."}

Such flavor structures are known as two-zero textures. Processes with charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), absent in the Standard Model (SM), can have sizable rates in this framework and are directly linked to the flavor structure of $M^ν$. For each allowed two-zero texture, we quantify the predicted correlations among various CLFV observables using current neutrino oscillation data and show that they lead to distinctive patterns of CLFV processes that could be discriminated between at running and upcoming experiments. In addition, together with information from colliders, the sensitivity of these correlations to renormalization group (RG) effects could shed light on the potentially ultra-high scale where new dynamics (e.g. some underlying flavor symmetry) give rise to the two-zero texture. Furthermore, we find that certain zero textures, although not third-generation specific, can suppress $μ\\to e$ transitions while allowing the rate of the process $τ\\to \\barμee$ to be within the future experimental sensitivity, even when the RG evolution is taken into account. The lowest possible cut-off scale of the effective theory, constructed by treating the two-zero flavor structure of $M^ν$ as a CLFV spurion, can therefore reach $5-6$ TeV. Our results provide further motivation for searches for $τ$ CLFV at Belle II, as probes of new physics complementary to MEG II and the upcoming Mu3e, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, as well as for collider searches for doubly charged scalar bosons."}

Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters.

Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\\nabla T_y / \\nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios."}

Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we discover that lithium diffusion is not free but confined within cages formed by lead atoms, a phenomenon we term the chemical cage effect. Structurally, RDF and CSRO analyses confirm a stable local environment where Li is preferentially surrounded by Pb. Dynamically, the MSD and NGP reveal anomalous, heterogeneous lithium diffusion characterized by repeated cage-breaking events. The double-exponential relaxation of the Li-Pb bond probability further distinguishes the escape dynamics of Li from surface and bulk cages. ELF and DOS analyses identify the polar covalent Li-Pb bond as the electronic origin of this cage.

Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science."}

Fitting the semileptonic and 3-body $τ$ decay data simultaneously becomes computationally feasible because we employ a simple form factor parametrisation for the $Kπ$ form factor that manifestly connects the semileptonic and pair-production regions. We find good agreement with the data and use our analyses to infer $|V_{us}|$ and the parameters for the $Kπ$ form factors. Our result for $|V_{us}|$ sits between the results extracted from exclusive $K_{\\ell 2}$ and $K_{\\ell 3}$ decays and somewhat above the inclusive $τ$ decay result. Moreover, our results for the $K\\to π$ vector form factor at zero momentum transfer are compatible with lattice QCD determinations, despite not using lattice QCD inputs for this quantity. We are further able to determine some of the pole parameters of the individual scalar and vector $Kπ$ resonances with masses below the $τ$ mass.

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

We then construct an effective model for valley phonons with different phonon pseudoangular momenta (PAM) and identity their distinct intervalley-scattering channels. Our model obeys the selection rule between phonons and electrons with the orbital degree of freedom. Extending this framework to d-orbital electrons, our model is applied to describe the induced OAM in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem."}

For both compounds, we study the orbital and magnetic excitations and extract their dispersions along high-symmetry directions. Using a single-band Hubbard model and including higher-order exchange interactions, we derive the correlation factor $U/t$ for both compounds. A key finding is that despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion $U$, PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a correlation strength that is 20% stronger than that of its isostructural cuprate counterpart SrCuO$_2$. This indicates that a moderation of the correlation strength may further optimize superconductivity in nickelates."}

Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance."}

The one-to-one correspondence between threading dislocation (TD) contrasts in PCM images and the corresponding contrasts in multiphoton excitation photoluminescence (MPPL) images provides clear evidence that PCM can detect TDs with in-plane Burgers vector components. The contrast shape in PCM reflects the inclination of dislocations with respect to the surface normal: dot contrasts correspond to vertical dislocations, whereas line contrasts correspond to inclined dislocations.

It is well known that the SM Higgs field features a deeper, more stable minimum at large field values. While it is possible that our Universe began and remained in the electroweak vacuum at all times, this scenario is extremely fine-tuned from the point of view of initial conditions. This fine-tuning can be ameliorated by the exponential expansion of spacetime during inflation: intriguingly, this requires at least $\\sim 40$ e-folds of inflation, tantalizingly close to the $50-60$ e-folds expected from horizon and flatness considerations. The Higgs could thus provide the reason for a prolonged epoch of inflation in our cosmic history. Otherwise, the most natural initial state corresponds to our Universe initialized in the more stable but \"wrong\" Higgs vacuum, and subsequently driven dynamically to the weak scale vacuum during reheating. An important, hitherto unexplored aspect of this dynamics is that the barrier between the two vacua persists when the electroweak vacuum becomes energetically favorable, becoming arbitrarily small as the temperature increases, and therefore triggers a first-order phase transition. This transition produces ultra-high (megahertz to gigahertz) frequency gravitational waves (GWs), serving as a challenging but unique SM target for GW experiments. Novel pathways for various beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as the production of dark matter and baryon asymmetry also become possible in this configuration."}

The metallic La3ScBi5 exhibits a low-temperature plateau of electrical resistivity and quasi-linear positive magnetoresistance, with anisotropic magnetoresistive behaviors suggesting the presence of anisotropic Fermi surfaces. This distinctive transport phenomenon is perfectly elucidated by first-principles calculations utilizing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Furthermore, the nonlinear Hall resistivity pointed towards a multiband electronic structure, characterized by the coexistence of electron and hole carriers, which is further supported by our first-principles calculations.

We construct a benchmark model which generates the top mass at tree level, and the bottom, charm, tau, and tau Dirac neutrino masses at one-loop level. Current theoretical and experimental constraints on the model, including from Higgs decays, demonstrate it possesses viable regions of parameter space.

Tunable devices are fabricated from indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanomembranes placed on monolithic piezoelectric substrates. Circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators enhance emission brightness and exploit the Purcell effect; however, the inclusion of CBGs reduces strain-mediated tunability compared to planar nanomembranes. A simple and effective solution is introduced: filling the CBG trenches with a stiff dielectric (aluminum oxide) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) restores up to 95% of the tunability of planar structures. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms that the tunability loss originates from bending in the device layers due to strain relief in the CBG geometry. Lowering the stiffness of intermediate layers between the QDs and the piezoelectric actuator, such as in bonding or reflector layers, further increases strain losses in uncoated CBGs. Coated devices maintain 98-99% strain-tuning efficiency across all simulated underlayer stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that advantageous optical cavity properties can be effectively combined with piezoelectric strain tuning, enabling scalable, bright, and tunable quantum light sources."}

For both compounds, we study the orbital and magnetic excitations and extract their dispersions along high-symmetry directions. Using a single-band Hubbard model and including higher-order exchange interactions, we derive the correlation factor $U/t$ for both compounds. A key finding is that despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion $U$, PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a correlation strength that is 20% stronger than that of its isostructural cuprate counterpart SrCuO$_2$.

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

The findings reveal a complex sequence of phase transformations and corresponding structural changes over a broad temperature range (from room temperature up to 800 $°$C). Two distinct body-centered cubic (bcc) $β$ phases - $β_{Zr}$ and $β_{Nb}$ - with closely related lattice parameters are identified. At room temperature, the microstructure is characterized by a mixture of the metastable $β_{Zr}$ + $ω_{ath}$ phase. Upon heating, $β_{Zr}$ progressively decomposes, giving rise to the formation of $β_{Nb}$. TEM observation revealed the cuboidal shape of the $ω_{iso}$ particles resulting from the high lattice misfit between $β$ and $ω$ phase. The $ω$ solvus temperature is determined to be approximately 555 $°$C, as evidenced by in situ HEXRD and abrupt changes in the alloy's thermal and electrical properties. The growth of the $α$ phase occurs after the dissolution of the $ω$ phase, resulting in a pronounced increase in thermal expansion."}

To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile."}

First, we trained CatBoost models with literature-derived Pd alloy data to predict $H_2$ permeability from composition and testing conditions. We evaluated fractional, composition-based, and physics-informed descriptors, individually and in combination, and showed that sequential Pearson filtering and fold-wise SHAP-based recursive feature elimination with cross-fold aggregation reduced errors while controlling complexity. Guided by the one-SE rule, a narrower domain-informed set of 13 features provided the best accuracy parsimony trade-off ($R^2=0.81$), only 0.01 below the max. $R^2$ achievable with 3x the number of features. SHAP analysis indicated that high permeability is promoted by elevated temperature, lattice expansion relative to Pd, atomic size mismatch, and favorable mixing tendencies. Second, the selected model was applied to screen $Pd_{(100-x-y)}Cu_{x}M_{y}$ spanning 16 co-dopants M for B2 stabilization. For each M system, we obtained the Pareto set of compositions that minimize Pd content and Miedema heat of formation and maximize the permeability, then picked three compounds, including that with the highest predicted permeability, the lowest Miedema heat of formation, and the lowest Pd content. With a final filter considering M concentration for single-phase Pd-M solution formation, we recommend Pd48.48Cu43.00Y8.52, Pd49.08Cu42.45Sc8.47, Pd56.09Cu33.70La10.21, and Pd52.68Cu40.44Mg6.88 for experimental validation.

The ability to tune SAW parameters is crucial to achieve an acoustic control over magnonic properties. Such tunability can be achieved in phase-changing magnetic materials accommodating both spin waves and SAWs. A promising material is FeRh alloy, a metallic antiferromagnet at room temperature undergoing a phase transition into ferromagnetic state accompanied by a crystal lattice expansion at 370 K. This transition can also be induced by femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper we use the phase transition in 60 nm Fe49Rh51 film to optically generate pulses of Gigahertz quasi-Rayleigh SAWs. We detect them via photoelastic effect and show that the lattice transformation during phase transition is a dominant strain-generation mechanism for above-threshold excitation. The weight of this contribution rises as the sample is heated closer to AFM-FM transition temperature and 'switches off' when heated above it allowing to control the SAW amplitude. A model based on thermodynamical parameters of Fe49Rh51 shows that the lattice transformation occurring within 95 ps effectively contributes to SAW generation happening at a comparable timescale, while non-equilibrium fast kinetics of the phase transition does not."}

While the effects of solar, geoneutrino, diffuse supernova, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within about 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond roughly 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These results establish reactor proximity as a critical site-dependent parameter in defining the neutrino floor and provide guidance for optimizing the design and siting of future low-threshold dark matter experiments."}

Since QCD evolution is fully determined within perturbation theory, the fitted PDFs should, in principle, be independent of the arbitrary choice of $Q_0$. In this work, we test this within the NNPDF framework by performing a series of fits at different starting scales, namely $Q_0 \\in {1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.65}$ GeV. We find that the resulting PDFs are consistent within uncertainties and the fit quality remains stable across this range, therefore confirming the invariance of PDF determinations with respect to the choice of starting scale."}

One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets."}

A promising solution posits that dark matter (DM) exhibits strong self-interaction, enhanced through the narrow resonance or Sommerfeld effects. We demonstrate that the ``super-resonance\" phenomenon, combining these effects, significantly amplifies the DM self-scattering cross section, enabling strong self-interactions for DM candidates in the $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV mass range. This mechanism also enhances the DM annihilation cross section, causing early kinetic decoupling that renders the standard Boltzmann equation inadequate. By implementing coupled Boltzmann equations, we achieve precise calculations of the relic density for super-resonant DM, aligning with observational constraints."}

Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\\nabla T_y / \\nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios."}

With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \\textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \\emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\\text{c}$ among QCs yet."}

Numerical results attached in Tex Source", "summary": "Compton scattering is a fundamental process in QED with broad applications, yet its theoretical description at high energies is challenged by substantial next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections arising from double-logarithmic enhancements. To address this, we report the first calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) total cross section with full electron mass dependence. Our analysis reveals that the NNLO correction, albeit still containing double logarithms, is numerically small due to a suppressing prefactor. By identifying the origin of these logarithms in a kinematic regime featuring a Glauber electron exchange, we successfully resum the leading logarithmic series to all orders, obtaining a compact result in terms of a modified Bessel function. The all-order structure reveals a suppression mechanism, with double factorial terms in the denominator, which explains the negligible nature of higher-order contributions. The combination of our NNLO calculation and all-orders resummation delivers a reliable and precise prediction, poised to serve the needs of high-precision experiments in the foreseeable future."}

Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance."}

Our universal foundation model is designed for simultaneous analysis of all processes involving from one to four top-quarks production with their corresponding background processes. The approach employs multi-task pre-training on combined datasets of simulated events, enabling the model to capture the full spectrum of interaction physics while extracting universal patterns across different final states prior to task-specific fine-tuning. This unified architecture eliminates the need for separate analysis frameworks for different final signatures and specific tasks. The transformer-based pre-training strategy explicitly preserves unique interaction patterns through adaptive attention mechanisms while establishing cross-process correlations. We plan to demonstrate how this architecture maintains sensitivity to rare high-multiplicity topologies (3t and 4t) without compromising performance on conventional channels ($t\\bar{t}$, $tX$, $t\\bar{t}H$), effectively bridging the gap between disparate analysis paradigms in collider physics."}
