This is contrary to the naive expectation that\ndisorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins\nwith their local environment. Given this unusual situation, it is essential to\nassess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. To\nperform this study, a minimal model for disordered quantum spin ice, the\ntransverse-field Ising model, is analyzed using a formulation of gauge\nmean-field theory (GMFT) directly in real space. This approach allows the\ninclusion of disorder effects exactly and provides access to non-perturbative\neffects. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable\nwith respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high\nfields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. Moreover, the Griffiths\nregion of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations appears tiny and restricted to\nthe immediate vicinity of this transition due to the uniqueness of the\nlow-energy excitations of the problem.

Although brief exposure duration and partial\nthermal decoupling introduced variability among samples, the overall results\nconfirm that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a\npurely thermal effect. This work provides new insight into vibration-induced\ncrystallization in fluoride glasses and establishes the experimental foundation\nfor follow-up modeling and apparatus optimization studies under terrestrial and\nmicrogravity conditions."}

Our\napproach incorporates isotropic hard thermal loop screening to model soft quark\nand gluon exchanges, allowing us to verify consistency with established\nanalytic results of jet transport coefficients. We perform kinetic simulations\nof minijets propagating through a thermal gluon plasma, incorporating both\ncollinear radiation and elastic scatterings. The resulting evolution is\ncompared to predictions from jet transport coefficients, including the\nlongitudinal and transverse jet-quenching parameters $\\hat{q}$, energy loss,\nand the drag coefficient. We find that standard definitions of jet transport\ncoefficients neglect the contributions from recoiling medium particles.\nIncluding these contributions restores consistency with the kinetic evolution.\nFinally, we show that the minijet thermalization time scales remarkably well\nwith $\\hat{q}$ and we produce a phenomenological estimate of the minijet\nquenching time in heavy-ion collisions."}

In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a\ncontinuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse\nwidths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in\nY3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the\ncharacteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their\nrelative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and\ncoherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse\nof 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate,\ncorresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle.

By finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo data, we identified the\ncritical exponents of the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and spin\ncorrelation length, $\\beta=0.508(30)$, $\\gamma=1.361(59)$, and $\\nu=0.792(17)$,\nrespectively.

These results show a new universality class inherent in\nthe i-QC, which is different from those in periodic magnets and spin glasses.\nIn the i-QC, each Yb site at vertices of the regular icosahedrons is classified\ninto 8 classes with respect to the coordination numbers of the nearest-neighbor\nand next-nearest-neighbor bonds.
