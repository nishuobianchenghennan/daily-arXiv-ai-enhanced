Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints."}

Both materials are close to a ferroelectric transition, but despite six decades of extensive research, pivotal questions regarding the nature of this transition and of the associated fluctuations remain debated. Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The present work resolves several long-standing questions pertaining to the model systems STO and KTO and is relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons."}

Mains", "Jia-Xin Zhong", "Yun Jing", "Bitan Roy"], "title": "Ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology", "comment": "17 Pages and 12 Figures", "summary": "In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices."}
