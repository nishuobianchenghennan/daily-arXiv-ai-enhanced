We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes."}

Here, we introduce a spectral sampling framework to quantify boron diffusion activation energies in Ni and demonstrate how substitutional solutes (Cr, Mo) reshape interstitial point defect transport in both the bulk and along crystallographic defects. In the bulk, boron migration energy distributions exhibit distinct modality tied to solute identity and spatial arrangement: both Cr and Mo raise barriers in symmetric cages but induce directional asymmetry in partially decorated environments. Extending this framework to a $\\Sigma5\\langle100\\rangle{210}$ symmetric tilt grain boundary reveals solute-specific confinement effects. Cr preserves low-barrier in-plane mobility while suppressing out-of-plane transport, guiding boron into favorable midplane voids. Mo, by contrast, imposes an across-the-board reduction in boron mobility, suppressing average diffusivity by two additional orders of magnitude at 800 $^\\circ$C and reducing out-of-plane transport by five orders of magnitude relative to Cr. Both elements promote segregation by producing negative segregation energies, but their roles diverge: Cr facilitates rapid redistribution and stabilization at interfacial sites, consistent with Cr-rich boride formation, while Mo creates deeper and more uniform segregation wells that strongly anchor boron. Together, these complementary behaviors explain the experimental prevalence of Cr- and Mo-rich borides at grain boundaries and carbide interfaces in Ni-based superalloys. More broadly, we establish spectral sampling as a transferable framework for interpreting diffusion in disordered alloys and for designing dopant strategies that control transport across complex interfaces."}

In this work, we introduce a unified in-context learning foundation model (ICL-FM) framework for materials property prediction that integrates both composition-based and structure-aware representations. The proposed approach couples the pretrained TabPFN transformer with graph neural network (GNN)-derived embeddings and our novel MagpieEX descriptors. MagpieEX augments traditional features with cation-anion interaction data to explicitly measure bond ionicity and charge-transfer asymmetry, capturing interatomic bonding characteristics that influence vibrational and thermal transport properties. Comprehensive experiments on the MatBench benchmark suite and a standalone lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) dataset demonstrate that ICL-FM achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with significantly reduced training costs. Remarkably, the training-free ICL-FM outperformed sophisticated SOTA GNN models in five out of six representative composition-based tasks, including a significant 9.93\\% improvement in phonon frequency prediction. On the LTC dataset, the FM effectively models complex phenomena such as phonon-phonon scattering and atomic mass contrast. t-SNE analysis reveals that the FM acts as a physics-aware feature refiner, transforming raw, disjoint feature clusters into continuous manifolds with gradual property transitions. This restructured latent space enhances interpolative prediction accuracy while aligning learned representations with underlying physical laws. This study establishes ICL-FM as a generalizable, data-efficient paradigm for materials informatics."}

However, atomistic simulations of ITO using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) are limited to systems of a few hundred atoms due to expensive computational costs, which prevents the device-scale modelling of real-world applications. In this work, we develop a machine-learned potential for ITO and its parent phase In2O3 based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework. We generate a comprehensive training dataset using an iterative training protocol. Our MLMD simulations of crystalline, liquid and melt-quenched amorphous ITO models are in great agreement with the AIMD reference. In particular, the ML potential well captures the minority atomic interaction, such as Sn-Sn bonds, which have poor statistics in small-scale AIMD simulations. We demonstrate that the MLMD simulations are 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than AIMD. The training dataset and the fitted GAP potentials for ITO and In2O3 are openly accessible."}

Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity."}

The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices."}

We construct QTT representations of the operator, payoffs, and boundary conditions with ranks that scale polynomially in d and polylogarithmically in the grid size, and build two solvers: a time-stepping algorithm for European and American options and a space-time algorithm for European options. We compute full-grid prices and Greeks for correlated basket and max-min options in three to five dimensions with high accuracy.

Interestingly, temperature-dependent bulk susceptibility curve shows ferrimagnetic-like behaviour above the magnetic ordering at around 40 K, which were corroborated by the identification of the mixed valence states, Ru5+ and Ru4+ via X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Structural analysis further revealed atomic-site exchange between the Ru and Sc sites, which results in the Ru mixed valence states. Neutron powder diffraction measurements detected the presence of magnetic Bragg peaks at a low temperature near 4 K and a moderate magnetoelastic coupling near the ordering temperature of 40 K. However, the corresponding symmetry analysis shows a weak Type I antiferromagnetic ground state with a reduced magnetic moment of 1.1μB/Ru atom. Our findings establish an unusual magnetic ground state in the Mott insulating Ca2ScRuO6, where a long range ordered antiferromagnet coexists with small magnetic clusters, which manifests a ferrimagnetic-like high temperature inverse magnetic susceptibility. This system presents a unique platform to study long-range magnetic order in the presence of antisite disorder."}

This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies.

Our system expands both contact size and load into the macroscopic regime, exhibiting friction coefficients that fluctuate around zero and reach values as low as $10^{-6}$ across a broad load range from 1 mN to 0.5 N. Negative friction coefficients are also observed. Similar behavior is observed at graphite/MoS$_2$ interfaces, indicating that macroscale SSL is a generalizable phenomenon across flat layered materials. These findings overturn long-standing scaling limitations and establish macroscale SSL as a paradigm-shifting platform for next-generation mechanical and electromechanical systems."}

Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity."}

Spherical neutron polarimetry and high-intensity single-crystal neutron diffraction reveal the first case of a longitudinal spin-density wave masking the ferromagnetic quantum critical point.

Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $α/β$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\\{100\\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\\{110\\}$- and $\\{211\\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices."}

However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems. Additionally, we discuss further generalizations and future directions, including higher dimensions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and realizations in modern experiments."}

The effects of 2 at.% cobalt (Co) addition on sintering behavior and high-temperature grain growth resistance were investigated as a function of compositional complexity. Activated sintering was observed, with 2 at.% Co addition increasing relative densities from ~92-96% to ~96-98%. Isothermal grain growth experiments at 1200 °C and 1300 °C showed that Co doping suppressed the relative grain growth rate, despite a modest initial grain size increase due to Co-activated sintering, with the effect becoming more pronounced in compositionally complex alloys. The observed trend is consistent with the recently proposed high-entropy grain boundary (HEGB) effect. Notably, Mo24.5W24.5Nb24.5Ta24.5Co2 achieved a 96.4% relative density and maintained an ultrafine grain size, increasing only slightly from ~122 nm to ~127 nm after 5 h annealing at 1200 °C.

However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)."}

The results, by combining both techniques, reveal that for both 3YSZ and 8YSZ, pressure promotes higher-symmetry structures. Under initial compression, the minority at ambient conditions monoclinic phase (m-phase) gradually transforms towards t-phase, a transition that is concluded for both 3YSZ/8YSZ at ~10 GPa. At higher pressures, the solely remaining t-phase of 3YSZ transforms to the t'', that in turns transforms to the c-phase above 28 GPa. Likewise, for 8YSZ the coexistence of t- and t''-phases continue up to 31 GPa, where both transforms towards c-phase, that remains stable up to the highest pressure of this study. Upon pressure release, all observed transitions are fully reversible with negligible hysteresis, with the exception of the practical disappearance of the monoclinic phase at ambient conditions.

However, rational design remains challenging due to the sensitivity of band tilting to lattice geometry, atomic coordination, and symmetry constraints. Here, we present a bottom-up approach to engineer ideal type-II nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) in van der Waals bilayers via atomic intercalation. Using monolayer $h$-AlN as a prototype, we show that fluorine-intercalated bilayer AlN (F@BL-AlN) hosts a symmetry-protected type-II nodal loop precisely at the Fermi level, enabled by preserved mirror symmetry ($\\mathcal{M}_z$) and tailored interlayer hybridization. First-principles calculations reveal that fluorine not only tunes interlayer coupling but also aligns the Fermi energy with the nodal line, stabilizing the type-II NLSM phase. The system exhibits tunable electronic properties under external electric and strain fields and features a van Hove singularity that induces spontaneous ferromagnetism, realizing a ferromagnetic topological semimetal state. This work provides a versatile platform for designing type-II NLSMs and offers practical guidance for their experimental realization."}

Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\\lesssim M_{\\rm DM}\\lesssim2000 {\\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\\rm GeV}\\lesssim M_{\\rm DM}\\lesssim 1000 {\\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass.

Using the Keldysh formalism within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework, we derive analytical expressions for radiative power, force, and torque. To enable angular momentum radiation, an out-of-plane magnetic field is applied to break reciprocity, resulting in gyrotropic terms in the permittivity tensor. By approximating the emitter as a thin film, the photon Green's functions can be solved analytically. Expressions for the Poynting vector and Maxwell's stress tensor can subsequently be extracted from the lesser Green's function, which governs the field correlations. The final radiation formulas can be expressed in terms of Fresnel coefficients, revealing an insightful connection to energy conservation via Kirchhoff's law. Using the Wigner transform, the analytical expression for the radiative torque can also be related to the generalized Fresnel coefficients. Numerical calculations based on the optical conductivity of bismuth are presented to corroborate the analytical results. These results provide a unified framework for energy, momentum, and angular momentum radiation in gyrotropic thin films."}

We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Al-6.8%Cu nanoparticles to explore atomic-scale mechanisms governing the full thermal sintering cycle. We demonstrate that while the sintering temperature primarily initiates neck formation, the subsequent cooling rate is the dominant kinetic parameter dictating the final microstructure. Fast cooling rates trap a significantly higher density of stacking faults and can unexpectedly lead to the formation of an amorphous phase at the interparticle interfaces, a feature critically dependent on the rate of thermal dissipation. We confirm a clear shift in the coalescence mechanism from plastic deformation (dislocation slip) at low temperatures (300 K and 450 K) to mass transport via atomic diffusion at high temperatures (600 K). These findings provide essential, atomic-scale guidelines for controlling thermal processing, particularly cooling rates, to design defect-stabilized, high-performance Al-Cu components."}
