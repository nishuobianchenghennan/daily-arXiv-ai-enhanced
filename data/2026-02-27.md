Abstract: The dark photon is a well-motivated ultralight dark-matter candidate that may couple to the Standard Model through kinetic mixing. We search for dark-photon dark matter in the mass range $m_{A'}c^2 = 4\times10^{-12}$-$2\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$ (1-500 kHz) using a three-axis magnetometer inside a large conductive shielded room. We set new laboratory limits on the kinetic-mixing parameter $ε$, improving upon previous laboratory bounds by up to three orders of magnitude. Our search exploits a geometry-defined null response along one axis as a noise reference; a subtraction procedure reduces the noise floor and improves sensitivity. These results establish the strongest laboratory constraints in this mass range and illustrate how null-axis magnetometry can broaden terrestrial searches for ultralight vector dark matter.

Abstract: We apply, for the first time, Bayes Linear Emulation and History Matching to the calibration of non-perturbative models in Monte Carlo event generators. In contrast to the usual approach of "Monte Carlo tuning", History Matching does not result in best-fit plus ellipsoidal parameter uncertainty estimates but instead identifies all parameter space regions that are consistent with data. This approach leads to a systematic and robust quantification of parametric uncertainties in the models, especially in those challenging cases where different, possibly disjoint, regions of parameter space deliver similar results, which are usually not properly treated with current methodology. We highlight the power of this method with the hadronisation models available through Sherpa: the built-in cluster fragmentation Ahadic and string fragmentation through an interface to Pythia.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We derive a fluctuation dissipation relation connecting the drag and diffusion jet transport coefficients for an energetic light quark traversing a non-perturbative thermalized gluon plasma. The hard quark is taken to be close to on-shell, with an energy scale parametrically larger than the medium temperature. We introduce a general complex-valued function for each transport coefficient. Evaluating these in the deep Euclidean momentum region enables their expression in terms of local operators. Using contour-integration techniques, we relate these local operators, after vacuum subtraction, to the physical transport coefficients that arise along a branch cut, close to light-like dispersion. The derived relation relates the longitudinal drag coefficient to the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients, a $4^{\rm th}$ order fluctuation, and the thermal gluon condensate.

Abstract: We explore the prospects of detecting flavorful lepton number violation at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) through resonant production of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), resulting in $e^- p \to \ell^+_α+ k\, j+X$, where $α\in \{e, μ, τ\}$ and $k$ denotes the number of jets. We work in the $ν$SMEFT framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory augmented with $n$ singlet HNLs, one of which is in the mass range $10-100$~GeV, within kinematic reach of the EIC. To explore the EIC sensitivity, we focus on the HNL production mechanism induced by mixing with light neutrinos. We study kinematic distributions for signal and backgrounds, including hadronization and detector effects, and suggest a set of cuts to minimize backgrounds. In the mass range considered, we find that the EIC with muon detection capabilities and an integrated luminosity of $100~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ can reach sensitivities comparable to the strongest direct (LHC) and indirect constraints, and is especially relevant in the $ν$SMEFT framework beyond dimension four. Our study motivates further assessment of muon detection capabilities at the EIC and $τ$ hadronic reconstruction, as well as a more general theoretical analysis involving production mechanisms mediated by higher-dimensional operators in the effective theory.

Abstract: Cosmic strings are topological defects arising in a variety of cosmological scenarios, as the Universe undergoes symmetry-breaking phase transitions, whose discovery would offer valuable insight into the high-energy physics that shaped the early Universe. To interpret such a detection, robust theoretical models are essential. The Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model is particularly prominent: it self-consistently treats the network as a thermodynamic system, characterizing its key properties, and predicting its large-scale evolution. This has recently been extended to include superconducting cosmic strings, which carry additional degrees of freedom, giving rise to the Charge-Velocity dependent One-Scale (CVOS) model. One limitation of the latter model is that it only included loss mechanisms for the charge and current. Here, we extend this model by phenomenologically including a possible energy source mechanism, specifically by allowing current-carrying strings interactions with an external magnetic field. We discuss how this coupling impacts the network's evolution, present and classify the physically allowed scaling solutions for this extended CVOS model, and comment on the different impacts of the external magnetic field on the evolution of the network's charge and current. Under our modeling assumptions, one of the ten physically plausible scaling solution enables the network to gain energy by this mechanism.

Abstract: The spin nematic phase, characterized by long-range order of spin quadrupole moments in the absence of dipolar magnetism, presents a significant challenge for conventional experimental detection. We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering. Our formalism offers a direct and powerful method to uncover the hidden spin nematicity, opening a new pathway for diagnosing multipolar orders in quantum magnets.

Abstract: Individual spin defects in solids are promising building blocks for quantum technologies, but their deterministic creation, individual addressability, and operation near surfaces remain major challenges. Two-dimensional materials provide an attractive alternative, as their single-layer thickness enables direct atomic-scale access to defect states. Here, we demonstrate single-spin control of solid-state defects in a two-dimensional semiconductor by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. We create and manipulate individual sulfur vacancies and carbon substitution defects in monolayer molybdenum disulfide and characterize their spin dynamics, including coherent control, at the single-defect level. Using atomic manipulation, we further engineer and probe spin-spin interactions between defect pairs. Our results demonstrate deterministic creation, addressability, coherent manipulation, and controlled coupling of individual spin defects within a single experimental platform. This establishes atomically engineered spin defects in two-dimensional semiconductors as a versatile class of controllable solid-state quantum systems and opens a route towards tailored quantum sensing experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Two anyons encircling each other acquire a quantized braiding phase that is independent of their spatial separation. We show that detecting this phase in a fractional quantum Hall interference experiment results in a quantum Zeno effect: a localized anyon is trapped by constant observation from a stream of anyons supplied by the measurement current. Interferometers with an embedded antidot are ideal for accessing the Zeno regime, where the bare tunneling rate of localized anyons is much lower than the measurement rate. The Zeno-suppressed tunneling rate of the trapped anyon depends on the braiding phase and the transmission of the quantum point contacts. Our primary prediction is that the autocorrelation time of the conductance through the interferometer increases with the bias current. This effect may be used to experimentally control the anyon dynamics, in particular to increase the lifetime of localized anyons.

Abstract: We demonstrate the presence of quantum interference effects in van der Waals heterostructures subject to in-plane electric fields. The in-plane field $F$ accelerates carriers through a hybridized band edge, and interlayer Zener tunneling occurs by distinct pathways, resulting in a solid-state quantum interferometer with imprints in transport observables. For parabolic-band bilayers, we identify two characteristic signatures which are observable in lateral conductance: Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg oscillations in the band-overlap regime periodic in $1/F$ at small fields, resembling electric-field induced quantum oscillations, and a pronounced resonance at $F\propto T_0^{3/2}$ set by the interlayer tunneling $T_0$. These features provide a directly accessible probe of coherent interferometric dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures, and could be harnessed for more precise engineering and characterization.

Abstract: Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) operations such as matrix product operator contractions are prohibitively expensive for large bond dimensions. We propose an adaptive patching scheme that exploits block-sparse QTT structures to reduce costs through divide-and-conquer, adaptively partitioning tensors into smaller patches with reduced bond dimensions. We demonstrate substantial improvements for sharply localized functions and show efficient computation of bubble diagrams and Bethe-Salpeter equations, opening the door to practical large-scale QTT-based computations previously beyond reach.

Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in KTaO$_3$ (KTO)-based two-dimensional electron gases for the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic orientations within a unified microscopic framework. Using a self-consistent tight-binding slab model, we determine the confinement potential, electronic structure, and orbital composition for each orientation, explicitly including inversion-symmetry-induced orbital Rashba couplings. Using a local spin-singlet s-wave pairing interaction, we find that the pronounced orientation dependence of the superconducting critical temperature primarily originates from differences in the spatial extent of the two-dimensional electron gas and the associated redistribution of the density of states at the Fermi level, rather than from changes in the pairing interaction. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.

Abstract: Atomic-scale disorder is conventionally regarded as detrimental to superconductivity; however, under specific conditions, it can enhance superconducting properties. Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$.
  Both $T_c^\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state.
  To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.

Abstract: Cooper-pair density modulation (CPDM) states are superconducting phases in which the order parameter varies periodically in real space without breaking translational symmetry. Recently, moire superlattices in layered materials have emerged as powerful platforms for engineering charge density with tunable lattice symmetry, offering a new route to creating and controlling CPDM states. In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moiré superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states. Our work demonstrates an epitaxial strategy for synthesizing moire superlattices from materials with different crystal symmetries and reveals a new mechanism for engineering CPDM states in designer bilayer heterostructures.

Abstract: Altermagnets emerge as a novel platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity through their exotic momentum-dependent spin-splitting of electronic band structures. Recent experiments have uncovered a novel form of altermagnetism with distinctive $g$-wave symmetry in CrSb. However, the potential for unconventional superconductivity arising from $g$-wave altermagnetism in such systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries. These findings underscore the potential of $g$-wave altermagnets to host sought-after chiral and gapless superconductivity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Employing a renormalization group analysis that allows for an unbiased treatment of competing physical ingredients, we systematically trace how the interplay between Cooper pairing and disorder scatterings governs the emergence or suppression of Cooper instability in the low-energy regime of fractional Dirac semimetals.In the clean limit, we find that the emergence of Cooper instability requires surpassing a finite interaction threshold $|λ_c|$, and depends sensitively on both the fractional exponent $α$ and the transfer momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(Q,φ)$. Specifically, bigger values of $α$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $α\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,φ)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed. In the presence of disorders, we demonstrate that they can either promote or suppress Cooper instability. Disorder of type $Δ_1$ or $Δ_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|λ_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|λ_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($Δ_1$, $Δ_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$), the suppressive influence of $Δ_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $Δ_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials.

Abstract: Quantum interference phenomena in superconductors, such as Josephson interference and Little-Parks oscillations, serve as powerful probes of phase coherence, symmetry breaking and vortex dynamics. However, they are typically observed in well-defined mesoscopic structures, and their behavior in the two-dimensional limit remains largely unexplored. Here, we report periodic magnetoresistance oscillations, superconducting interference patterns, and interfering diode effect in unpatterned few-layer NbSe2. These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops. Our results reveal that the observed interference phenomena originate from the lost of global phase coherence, providing a new route to accessing interference effects in unpatterned superconductors.

Abstract: Nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetries provide a robust route to symmetry-protected electronic topology, yet their role in stabilizing intrinsic topological superconductivity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report \ch{TaPtSi} as a new member of the superconducting nonsymmorphic silicide family, characterized via AC transport, magnetization, heat capacity, and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) measurements. Zero field $μ$SR reveals spontaneous internal magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$, establishing time reversal symmetry breaking in \ch{TaPtSi}. First principles calculations on \ch{TaPtSi} and its isostructural nonsymmorphic superconducting analogues reveal the presence of symmetry-protected hourglass dispersions. The "necks" of these dispersions form Dirac nodal rings and chains that reside near or intersect the Fermi level. Guided by Ginzburg Landau symmetry analysis, we identify an internally antisymmetric non unitary triplet pairing state as the unique ground state consistent with the experimental phenomenology. Based on Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations, we further demonstrate that this state supports Majorana surface modes, establishing its intrinsically topological nature. These results reveal a systematic route by which nonsymmorphic symmetry drives the interplay between hourglass Dirac chain topology and unconventional triplet pairing, positioning equiatomic silicides as a unified materials platform for intrinsic topological superconductivity.

Abstract: Thermal transport in complex solids is governed by local structure, defects, and anisotropy, yet most continuum models still rely on oversimplified, homogenized conductivities. Here, we bridge atomistic and continuum descriptions by building finite element (FE) models directly from the site-projected thermal conductivity (SPTC), an atomic-level decomposition of the Green-Kubo thermal conductivity. We introduce a new toolkit, the Simulator Collection for Atomic-to-Continuum Scales (SCACS), which uses a graph neural network to predict SPTC on large atomic structures, coarse-grain these fields into anisotropic conductivity tensors, and embeds them into the heat-flow FE equation with a customized, anisotropy-aware adaptive mesh refinement scheme. Applied to silicon nanostructures, the resulting FE models act as representative volume elements, reproduce bulk conductivities, and capture interfacial and defect-driven anisotropy while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Additionally, SCACS predicts experimental conductance trends and fields. This innovation demonstrates a novel and general route for transferring atomistic transport information into device-scale thermal simulations with physics-based approximations.

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing level of control over van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has opened new routes to tune the properties of quantum materials. Motivated by these developments, we examine the potential consequences of interfacing a Kitaev honeycomb magnet, such as $α$-RuCl$_3$, with a nearly lattice-matched vdW antiferromagnet. By combining perturbation theory, exact diagonalization, and a classical energy-minimization method, we show that an effective staggered magnetic field originating from the vdW antiferromagnet can drive a monolayer of a Kitaev material into various novel phases, including an antichiral Kitaev spin liquid, a nonmagnetic nematic phase, and different types of skyrmion crystals. We then apply first-principle simulations to assess the prospect of concretely realizing this setup in a heterobilayer of $α$-RuCl$_3$ and the easy-axis antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$.

Abstract: We study the paradigmatic spin-1 XY chain under open boundary conditions, which hosts exact quantum many-body scars generated by an emergent Spectrum Generating Algebra (SGA). We show that the scar subspace possesses a symmetry-protected trivial (SPt) character that we attribute to a hidden $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry of another model, namely the commutant Hamiltonian, for which the scars are the ground states. We construct a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type twist operator, which, for scar states, takes the value $-1,$ and, for ergodic states, approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit. A complementary understanding of the stability of the scars under different perturbations is obtained by analyzing the Loschmidt echo and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the scars. Finite-size scaling analysis of the QFI reveals that the scars are much more sensitive to perturbations as compared to the nearby thermal states. Based on the analysis of QFI and different LSM twist operators, we obtain a classification of different SGA-preserving and SGA-breaking perturbations.

Abstract: Electron interactions can drive magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $β$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $β$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $β$-UTe$_3$. Our expansion of the Kondo phase diagram beyond spin-mediated competition opens new possibilities for proximity-induced phase engineering in correlated van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the single-particle Bloch wavefunction changes in phase and amplitude across the Brillouin Zone. In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moiré materials.

Abstract: We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $θ$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(θ,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $θ$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $θ$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $θ$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.
