When those two energy scales are\nroughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry,\nwhich we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these\nQCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed\ntopological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the\ncharge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no\ndirect transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size\nfrom filling constraints, i.e., the \"minimal\" WMI, and the topological order\nwith the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling\nconstraints, i.e., the \"minimal\" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum\nmelting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the\nproliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this\ntransition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors\nto the anyon excitations in the QCLs."}

Imposing symmetries and locality results in novel\nphenomena absent in ordinary quantum mechanical systems. A single fracton has a\nvanishing Hamiltonian, and thus its spectrum is entirely composed of zero\nmodes. For the two-body problem, the Hamiltonian is perfectly described by\nSturm--Liouville (SL) theory. The effective two-body Hamiltonian is an SL\noperator on $(-1,1)$ whose spectral type is set by the edge behavior of the\npair inertia function $K(x)\\sim \\lvert x -x_\\mathrm{edge} \\rvert^{\\theta}$. We\nidentify a sharp transition at $\\theta=2$: for $\\theta<2$ the spectrum is\ndiscrete and wavepackets reflect from the edges, whereas for $\\theta>2$ the\nspectrum is continuous and wavepackets slow down and, dominantly, squeeze into\nasymptotically narrow regions at the edges. For three particles, the\ndifferential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian is piecewise defined,\nrequiring several \"matching conditions\" which cannot be analyzed as easily. We\nproceed with a lattice regularization that preserves dipole conservation, and\nimplicitly selects a particular continuum Hamiltonian that we analyze\nnumerically.

We provide intuition for these results which\nsuggests that the lack of ergodicity of classical continuum fractons will\nsurvive their quantization for large systems."}

Observations of electron-paramagnetic resonance and direct systematic\nmeasurements of T2 has seen an anomaly where T2 increases with increasing\ntemperature. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly. We find that due to a spontaneous symmetry lowering from a\nmotional Jahn-Teller distortion, a polaron quasi-particle is generated from the\nvibronic coupling. Initially, for temperatures from 8 to 20 - 40K, the\ncoherence temperature dependence is dominated by phonon-assisted spin\nrelaxation. At temperatures around 20 - 40K, depending on the vacancy, a\nthermally activated polaron hopping turns on and motional narrowing dominates\nand increases T2 with increasing temperature. As temperatures reach 120 - 160K,\nthe energy barrier gets high enough to slow the polaron hopping. At this point\nthe Larmor precession dominates, leading to decoherence. Our calculated\ntemperature-dependent coherence agrees with what has been seen experimentally,\ngiving a full theoretical framework for the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly of increasing T2 with increasing temperature. The\ntheoretical framework presented here also gives insight into these mechanisms\nbeing a probable universal phenomenon that could occur in many other defect\ncenter spin systems."}

In the device research field, photoelectron\nyield spectroscopy (PYS) has been widely used to evaluate such states, and its\nderivative is commonly employed to estimate the density of states (DOS).\nHowever, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic\nsemiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly\nrepresent the DOS. Here, we applied hv-dependent high-sensitivity ultraviolet\nphotoelectron spectroscopy with low-energy photons to probe the origin of\nphotoelectrons in organic semiconductors.

Because the BEE signal\nmasks the DOS, derivative PYS can misestimate the DOS of in-gap states. In\ncontrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) can reliably\ndetermine the DOS. For example, in Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3), we\nobserved BEE, and CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap states and SOMO over six\norders of magnitude.

We studied the cubic double\nperovskite Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ containing the Os$^{6+}$ ($5d^2$) ions, which\nexhibits a phase transition to a `hidden order' below $T^* \\sim$ 50 K, by X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at\nthe Os $L_{2,3}$ edge. The cubic ligand-field splitting between the $t_{2g}$\nand $e_g$ levels of Os $5d$ was deduced by XAS to be $\\sim$4 eV. The\ntemperature dependence of the XMCD spectra was consistent with a $\\sim$18 meV\nresidual cubic splitting of the lowest $J_{\\rm eff} =$ 2 multiplet state into\nthe non-Kramers $E_g$ doublet ground state and the $T_{2g}$ triplet excited\nstate. Ligand-field (LF) multiplet calculation under fictitious strong magnetic\nfields indicated that the exchange interaction between nearest-neighbor\noctupoles should be as strong as $\\sim$1.5 meV if a ferro-octupole order is\nstabilized in the `hidden-ordered' state, consistent with the exchange\ninteraction of $\\sim$1 meV previously predicted theoretically using model and\ndensity functional theory calculations."}

One of the proposed scenarios is the excitonic insulator\n(EI) mechanism, where soft electronic mode drives the phase transition.\nHowever, the existence of this purely electronic mode is controversial. Here,\nwe perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in\nTiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter\nequations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is\ndominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic\nmodes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the\nstructural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$\nstates, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in\nthe optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV. Close to the transition temperature\n$T_{\\rm CDW}$, these two excitonic modes are softened and approach zero energy.\nThese results suggest that the EI mechanism is not a main driving force in the\nformation of the CDW phase in TiSe$_2$, but there is a region in the phase\ndiagram near $T_{\\rm CDW}$ where EI fluctuations could be relevant."}

After a brief summary of the properties of the\npolarization tensor of graphene obtained within Dirac model in the framework of\nquantum field theory, we derive the expressions for the longitudinal and\ntransverse dielectric functions. The behavior of these functions at different\ntemperatures is investigated in the regions below and above the threshold.\nSpecial attention is paid to the double pole at zero frequency which is present\nin the transverse response function of graphene. An application of the response\nfunctions of graphene to calculation of the equilibrium Casimir force between\ntwo graphene sheets and Casimir-Polder forces between an atom (nanoparticle)\nand a graphene sheet is considered with due attention to the role of a nonzero\nenergy gap, chemical potential and a material substrate underlying the graphene\nsheet. The same subject is discussed for out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir and\nCasimir-Polder forces. The role of the obtained and presented results for\nfundamental science and nanotechnology is outlined."}

The QAH phase hosts\nunidirectional transport channels known as chiral edge states, while the\nmetallic phase exhibits non-reciprocal transport due to unbalanced\nbidirectional edge states. Utilizing the chiral edge states in Cr-doped (Bi,\nSb)2Te3 sandwich structures, we realize non-Hermitian conductance matrices in a\none-dimensional Corbino chain with well-defined chirality. By tuning the\nboundary conditions from open to periodic, we reveal the non-Hermitian skin\neffect, where eigenstates localize exponentially at one end of the chain. In\nthe metallic phase, we further observe asymmetric, bidirectional coupling\nbetween the neighboring sites in the conductance matrix, a direct consequence\nof the system's intrinsic non-reciprocity. These results establish magnetic TIs\nas a powerful platform for investigating emergent non-Hermitian phenomena in\ntopological systems."}
