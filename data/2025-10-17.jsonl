However, further progress in hBN-based\nquantum technologies requires a deeper understanding of the physics and\nchemistry of hBN defects. In this work, we employ ab initio calculations to\ninvestigate the thermodynamic stability and optical properties of defect\ncomplexes involving carbon, boron vacancies, and hydrogen. We demonstrate that\nthe formation of CBVB-nH complexes (n from 0 to 3) is energetically favorable\nunder nitrogen-rich conditions in the presence of carbon and hydrogen. The low\nformation energies and high binding energies of these complexes arise from the\nstrong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged carbon\nsubstitutional defect (CB) and the negatively charged hydrogen-passivated boron\nvacancies (VB-nH). These complexes are particularly likely to form in\nmetal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown samples, where growth occurs in\nthe presence of carbon and hydrogen and is accompanied by a high density of\nboron vacancies. The optical properties of CBVB-nH complexes are analyzed and\ncompared to recent photoluminescence measurements on MOVPE-grown hBN samples.\nIn particular, we investigate the origin of the emission peaks at 1.90 eV and\n2.24 eV and demonstrate that both the energies and lineshapes are consistent\nwith hole capture by negatively charged CBVB and CBVB-H complexes."}

Observation of this symmetry in the\nvacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies\nthat the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark\ncondensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are\nnot directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry\nrestoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with\nchirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining\nelectric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature\nT_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears\nsuggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a\nvery smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has\nbeen further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy\ndensity, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as\nN_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We\nhave analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above\nT_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid.\nWhen N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the\nthree-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally\nsymmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry\nrestoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet\nquark-antiquark systems that become very large at T > T_ch. Consequently the\nstringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the\noverlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark \"mesons\" with a very small\nmean free path."}

This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can\noccur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly\ndemonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using\nfull counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the\nperformance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing\nperformance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty\nrelations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on\ntwo operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the\nnonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes\nsignificantly differ in precision.

Herein, we achieve ultralow\n$\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ in lightweight cyanide-bridged framework materials (CFMs)\nthrough the rational integration of properties such as the hierarchical\nvibrations exhibited in superatomic structures and rotational dynamics\nexhibited in perovskites. Unique hierarchical rotation behavior leads to\nmultiple negative peaks in Gr\\\"uneisen parameters across a wide frequency\nrange, thereby inducing pronounced negative thermal expansion and strong cubic\nanharmonicity in CFMs. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between large\nfour-phonon scattering phase space (induced by phonon quasi-flat bands and wide\nbandgaps) and strong quartic anharmonicity (associated with rotation modes)\nleads to giant quartic anharmonic scattering rates in these materials.\nConsequently, the $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ of these CFMs decreases by one to two\norders of magnitude compared to the known perovskites or perovskite-like\nmaterials with equivalent average atomic masses.
