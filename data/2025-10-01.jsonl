However, the\ninterpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles\nremains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of\norbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons\nand phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in\nbosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion\nof the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the\nlatter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional\nantiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum\ngeometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking,\nyielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM.\nWe propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage\ngenerated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the\nbosonic orbital degree of freedom.

In this article we review the thermoelectric\nperformance of topological materials, focusing specifically on nodal\nsemimetals, such as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. We discuss how certain\nunique ``topological'' features of these materials -- namely their\ntopologically protected band touching points, electron-hole degenerate lowest\nLandau level, and Berry curvature -- allow them to exhibit thermoelectric\nproperties that go beyond what is possible in conventional materials,\nparticularly in the presence of an applied magnetic field. We focus our\ndiscussion on the goal of achieving large figure of merit $zT$, and for each\nmaterial class we summarize optimal \\emph{design principles} for selecting\nmaterials that maximize thermoelectric efficiency.\n  We then use these optimal design principles to design and implement a\nhigh-throughput database search for topological semimetals that are promising\nas thermoelectrics. In addition to highlighting a number of materials that are\nalready known to have large magnetothermoelectric effects, our search uncovers\ntwelve additional materials that are especially promising for near-future\nexperiments."}

The\nformer naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real\nmaterials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic\nproperties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage,\nmaking it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we\nstudy the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional\n(2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the N\\'{e}el vector\norientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the N\\'{e}el\nvector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC,\nor qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a\nnovel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports,\nwhose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC.\nAdditionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY\nspin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be\ndetermined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic\nterm; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same\nmoderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin\nmodel with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates\nalso relies on the N\\'{e}el vector orientation and impurity configurations. All\nresults are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in\nprior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed\nN\\'{e}el vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic\nproperties of altermagnets."}

In the present study, Ti40V60 alloy thin films have\nbeen deposited using DC magnetron co sputtering of Ti and V at ambient\ntemperatures. The effect of deposition pressure on the film morphology,\nsuperconducting and normal state properties has been studied.

We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a\nquantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models.\nBased on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure\nfactors.

To resolve this issue, we\npropose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond\noperators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior\ndisappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is\nconsistent with the sign of the exchange constant.

However, lattice\nsimulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW\narea on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically,\nits infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR\nmodes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the\narea parameter $\\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value\n$\\xi_{max} \\approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of\nnon-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary.\nAssuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one\nrecognizes $\\xi \\approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally\nsuppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the\nscaling regime.

While the spin Edelstein effect (SEE), originating from\nspin moments, is well established, its orbital counterpart, where magnetization\narises from orbital moment, has only recently begun to attract attention. In\nthis work, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) in gated monolayer\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, by using\nfirst-principles density-functional calculations with both electron and hole\ndoping. The gate-induced broken mirror symmetry produces a Rashba-type chiral\nspin/orbital angular momentum texture, which in turn leads to the Edelstein\neffect in response to an applied in-plane electric field. We find that for\nelectron doping the Edelstein response is dominated by the orbital channel,\nwhereas for hole doping the orbital and spin contributions are comparable. For\nthe case of hole doping, both OEE and SEE are strongly enhanced by a small\namount of strain, due to strain-driven shifts between the Gamma and K/K' valley\nenergies.

In this work, we investigate how an additional\nevaporation barrier - arising either from multiple scattering in an optically\nthick regime or from a long-range DM-nucleon interaction - modifies this\nequilibrium. We compute the transport and thermalization of captured DM using a\nphase-space approach that evolves the orbital distribution rather than assuming\na Maxwellian form.

However, the vitrification of MIOC is challenging\nsince most of the crystalline MIOC precursors decompose before melting. The\ndecomposition problem severely narrows the compositional range of MIOC glass\nformation. Here, we report a novel approach for preparing the MIOC glasses that\ncombines slow-solvent-removal with subsequent quenching to avoid gel thermal\ndecomposition and crystallization. Specifically, the new approach utilizes an\naprotic solvent (acetone) to kinetically prevent the ordering of the\nmetal-ligand complex molecules in solution, thereby suppressing crystallization\nand forming a gel. The subsequent gradual drying process leads to the removal\nof the solvent to enhance the connections between molecules through hydrogen\nbonds, thus causing the formation of a hydrogen-bonded network. The increased\nnetwork connectivity lowers the mobility of the molecules, thereby avoiding gel\ncrystallization. Consequently, a disordered network is frozen-in during\nquenching of the dried gel from 130 {\\deg}C to room temperature, and finally\nMIOC glass forms. Structural analyses reveal that hydrogen bonds are\nresponsible for connecting the tetrahedral units. The as-prepared MIOC glass\nexhibits some fascinating behaviors, e.g., Tg increasing with rapid\nroom-temperature relaxation, CO2 uptake, and red-shift of photoluminescence.\nThis work not only presents a novel strategy for fabricating large-sized,\nstable, functional MIOC glasses, but also uncovers the critical role of\nhydrogen bonds in MIOC glass formation."}
