Abstract: This work presents multiterminal Josephson junctions in hybrid
semiconductor-superconductor InAsSb-Al nanocrosses. Hybrid nanocrosses are
grown using molecular beam epitaxy and are formed through As-assisted merging
of oppositely directed InAsSb nanowires. We explain this complex ternary
merging mechanism using a temperature-dependent phase diagram and investigate
the detailed crystal structure with atomic-resolution imaging. The hybrid
nanoscrosses enabled the fabrication of multiterminal Josephson junction
devices, which were characterized at low temperatures. The supercurrent through
each terminal combination was measured as a function of the density in the
junction and the relative phase of the terminals, which was controlled by an
external magnetic field.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The possibility of controlling spins using ultrashort light and strain pulses
has triggered intense discussions about the mechanisms responsible for magnetic
re-ordering. All-optical magnetisation switching can be achieved through
ultrafast heat-driven demagnetisation or transient modifications of magnetic
anisotropy. During the phononic switching of magnetic dielectrics, however,
mid-infrared optical excitations can modify the crystal environment via both
the thermal quenching of anisotropy and the generation of strain respectively,
with the relative distinction between these thermal and non-thermal processes
remaining an open question. Here, we examine the effect of mid-infrared pulses
tuned to the frequency of optical phonon resonances on the labyrinthine domain
structure of a cobalt-doped yttrium iron garnet film. We find that the
labyrinthine domains are transformed into stable parallel stripes, and
quantitative micromagnetic calculations demonstrate this stems predominantly
from a partial quenching of the anisotropy. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
however, we find that this heat-facilitated process of magnetisation switching
is spectrally strongest not at the maximum of absorbed optical energy but
rather at the epsilon-near-zero points. Our results reveal that the
epsilon-near-zero condition provides an alternative pathway for laser-driven
control of magnetisation, even when the underlying mechanism is primarily
thermal.

Abstract: Mixed valency in intermetallics with lanthanide cations is well established
as a pathway to unusual charge transport, complex magnetism, and
superconductivity. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of the
structural, magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties of the mixed valent
compound CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterize CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ as a
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) compound with mixed-valent Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$
on a single crystallographic site. $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy indicates
that the Fe sublattice is nonmagnetic, in direct contrast with recent reports
of this compound. Low-temperature electrical resistivity and heat capacity
measurements show no evidence of magnetic ordering, and a modest Sommerfeld
coefficient ($\gamma$) of 22.7 mJ/mol$\cdot$K$^2$ make extensive Kondo
hybridization unlikely. DC and AC magnetic susceptibility data suggest
short-range magnetic order at $\sim$5.2 and 7.6 K with no frequency dependence,
ruling out canonical spin-glass behavior in this compound. Additionally, the
magnetic susceptibility data does not contain any broad features that are
typically associated with an intermediate valence state in Ce, suggesting
either high-temperature valence fluctuation or a different mechanism of mixed
valency. This work demonstrates that mixed-valent Ce inhibits magnetic ordering
in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ and provides a broader picture for how to analyze short-range
spin interactions in Q1D intermetallics.

Abstract: Metal-insulator transitions and superconductivity in rutile-structured oxides
hold promise for advanced electronic applications, yet their thin film
synthesis is severely hindered by limited substrate options. Here, we present
three single- crystalline substrates, BeAl2O4, Mg2SiO4, and Al2SiO4(F,OH)2,
prepared via optimized thermal and chemical treatments to achieve atomically
smooth surfaces suitable for epitaxial growth. Atomic force microscopy confirms
atomic step-and-terrace surface morphologies, and oxide molecular-beam epitaxy
growth on these substrates demonstrates successful heteroepitaxy of rutile
TiO2, VO2, NbO2, and RuO2 films. Among these unconventional substrates, BeAl2O4
exhibits exceptional thermal and chemical stability, making it a versatile
substrate candidate. These findings introduce new substrate platforms that
facilitate strain engineering and exploration of rutile oxide thin films,
potentially advancing the study of their strain-dependent physical properties.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly advanced global crystal

In this study, global structure searches are performed for 11 bismuth-based
binary systems, including Na-Bi, Ca-Bi, and Eu-Bi, under pressures ranging from

representable within the explored configurational space. These results
highlight the robustness and reliability of the current MLP-based structure

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring a
wide range of ex- otic quantum phenomena. Unlike angstrom-scale materials, the
moir\'e length-scale system contains a large number of atoms, and its
electronic structure is significantly modulated by the lattice relaxation.
These features pose a huge theoretical challenge. Among the available
theoretical approaches, tight-binding (TB) methods are widely employed to
predict the electronic, transport, and optical properties of systems such as
twisted graphene, twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and related
moir\'e materials. In this review, we pro- vide a comprehensive overview of
atomistic TB Hamiltonians and the numerical techniques commonly used to model
graphene-based, TMD-based and hBN-based moir\'e superlattices. We also discuss
the connection between atomistic TB descriptions and effective low-energy
continuum models. Two examples of different moir\'e materials and geometries
are provided to emphasize the advantages of the TB methods. This review is
intended to serve as a theoretical and practical guide for those seeking to
apply TB methods to the study of various properties of moir\'e superlattices.

Abstract: Point defects, often formed during the growth of Janus MoSSe, act as built-in
scatterers and affect carrier transport in electronic devices based on Janus
MoSSe. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate
the impact of common defects, such as sulfur vacancies, selenium vacancies, and
chalcogen substitutions, on electron transport, and compare their influence
with that of mobility limited by phonons. Here, we define the saturation defect
concentration ($C_{\mathrm{sat}}$) as the highest defect density that still
allows the total mobility to remain within 90\% of the phonon-limited value,
providing a direct measure of how many defects a device can tolerate. Based on
$C_{\mathrm{sat}}$, we find a clear ranking of defect impact: selenium
substituting for sulfur is relatively tolerant, with
$C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx2.07\times10^{-4}$, while selenium vacancies are the
most sensitive, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx3.65\times10^{-5}$. Our
$C_{\mathrm{sat}}$ benchmarks and defect hierarchy provide quantitative,
materials-specific design rules that can guide the fabrication of high-mobility
field-effect transistors, electronic devices, and sensors based on Janus MoSSe.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We reveal intrinsic fracture nonreciprocity, manifesting as directional
asymmetry in crack resistance, in two-dimensional heterostructures engineered
through lattice-mismatched interfaces. Density-functional theory combined with
machine-learning molecular dynamics show that intrinsic lattice mismatch
between bonded component crystals imprints asymmetric prestrain states at crack
tips, governing bond-breaking thresholds through charge redistribution. The
failure criterion obeys a universal exponential scaling law between normalized
charge density and bond strain, insensitive to bonding chemistry and local
atomic environment. The magnitude of nonreciprocity scales systematically with
lattice mismatch, reaching 49% at 10% mismatch. Validation across hexagonal,
square, rectangular, and oblique two-dimensional lattices confirms
universality, establishing interface strain engineering as a general design
principle that bridges electronic structure to nanoscale failure, enabling
rational design of damage-tolerant nanostructures.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that are
promising candidates for low-power spintronic memory and logic devices.
Realizing skyrmion-based devices requires an understanding of how structural
disorder affects their stability and transport properties. This study uses
Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$
to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and
quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and
electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements
reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall
signal from a narrow window near 200\~K in pristine films down to 4\~K at the
highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the
anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to
linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing
threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect
concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral
magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control
over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability.

Abstract: We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast
photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial
graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field
spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural
inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer
graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes
doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs)
further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are
dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation
then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier
mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime.
The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the
scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase
of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c >$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced
electron-electron and electron- phonon scattering and to an interaction of
electrons with mid-gap states.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Melting is an everyday phase transition that is determined by thermodynamic
parameters like temperature and pressure. In contrast, ultrafast melting is
governed by the microscopic response to a rapid energy input and, thus, can
reveal the strength and dynamics of atomic bonds as well as the energy flow
rate to the lattice. Accurately describing these processes remains challenging
and requires detailed insights into transient states encountered. Here, we
present data from femtosecond electron diffraction measurements that capture
the structural evolution of copper during the ultrafast solid to liquid phase
transformations. At absorbed energy densities 2 to 4 times the melting
threshold, melting begins at the surface slightly below the nominal melting
point followed by rapid homogeneous melting throughout the volume. Molecular
dynamics simulations reproduce these observations and reveal a weak electron
lattice energy transfer rate for the given experimental conditions. Both
simulations and experiments show no indications of rapid lattice collapse when
its temperature surpasses proposed limits of superheating, providing evidence
that inherent dynamics limits the speed of disordering in ultrafast melting of
metals.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of materials science databases has driven machine
learning-based discovery while also posing challenges in data integration,
duplication, and interoperability. Robust standardization and de-duplication
methods are needed to address these issues and streamline materials research.
We present LeMat-Bulk, a unified dataset combining Materials Project, OQMD, and
Alexandria, encompassing over 5.3 million PBE-calculated materials and also
representing the largest collection of PBESol and SCAN functional calculations.
Our methodology standardizes calculations across databases that utilize
different parameters, effectively addressing redundancy and enhancing
cross-compatibility. To de-duplicate, we propose a hashing function which we
termed the Bonding Algorithm Weisfeiller-Lehman (BAWL). We comprehensively
benchmark this fingerprint under atomic noise, lattice strain, and symmetry
transformations, demonstrating that it outperforms existing fingerprinting
techniques such as SLICES, and CLOUD in robustness while offering greater
computational efficiency than similarity-based approaches such as Pymatgen's
StructureMatcher. Additionally, the fingerprint facilitates the analysis of
functional-dependent trends (PBE, PBESol, SCAN) offering a scalable framework
for data-driven materials science.

Abstract: Tunable electronic properties in magnetic materials lead to novel physical
phenomena that have the potential to be exploited in the design of new
spintronic devices. Here, we report the effect of uniaxial stress on the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the hexagonal frustrated antiferromagnetic
Heusler compound Mn3Ge. Our x-ray diffraction results show that the c/a ratio
varies linearly with strain when stress is applied along the a axis, as well as
a significantly higher Young's modulus along the c direction. The linear
behavior of the c/a ratio under uniaxial stress mirrors that seen under
hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa, but results in a characteristically
different behavior of the AHE. Stress applied along the a axis induces a
distortion in the ab plane, smoothing the abrupt jump in the AHE signal at zero
magnetic field. In contrast, stress applied along the c axis has little effect,
presumably due to the higher Young's modulus. We argue that this is due to
pronounced changes in magnetic order.

Abstract: Bi alloying is predicted to transform GaAs from a semiconductor to a
topological insulator or semi-metal. To date, studies of the GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$
alloy band structure have been limited, and the origins of Bi-induced
enhancement of the spin-orbit splitting energy, $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$, are
unresolved. Here, we present high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) of droplet-free epitaxial GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ films with
$x_{\mathrm{Bi}}$ = 0.06. In addition to quantifying the Bi-induced shifts of
the light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands, we probe the origins of the
Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$. Using exact-two-component density functional
theory calculations, we identify the key role of Bi p-orbitals in the upward
shift of the light-hole and heavy-hole bands that results in the Bi-enhanced
$\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$.

Abstract: The fabrication of large, high-quality single crystals (SCs) of all-inorganic
cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) via accessible methods remains a significant
challenge. This work presents a systematic approach to optimize the antisolvent
vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method, where the experimental design is
guided by a theoretical methods at each step. A synergistic 9:1 (v/v) DMSO/DMF
binary solvent was selected to balance solubility and kinetics, a choice
rationalized by an analysis of Gutmann's donor numbers. Subsequently, ethanol
was selected as a promising antisolvent by evaluating its properties against
key criteria of miscibility and diffusion rate using Hansen Solubility
Parameters (HSP) and Fick's law expressed in terms of saturated vapor pressure.
Within this rationally-defined chemical system, the "growth window" was
experimentally mapped, identifying an optimal precursor concentration of 0.35 M
and a preliminary titration step to induce a controlled metastable state. The
optimized protocol consistently yields phase-pure, orthorhombic CsPbBr$_3$ SCs
up to 1 cm in size within one week at room temperature. The resulting crystals
exhibit high crystallinity and thermal stability up to \SI{550}{\celsius}

Abstract: Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$ or LEED $I(E)$, the
evaluation of diffraction intensities $I$ as a function of the electron energy]
is a versatile technique for the study of surface structures. The technique is
based on optimizing the agreement between experimental and calculated
intensities. Today, the most commonly used measure of agreement is Pendry's $R$
factor $R_\mathrm{P}$. While $R_\mathrm{P}$ has many advantages, it also has
severe shortcomings, as it is a noisy target function for optimization and very
sensitive to small offsets of the intensity. Furthermore, $R_\mathrm{P} = 0$,
which is meant to imply perfect agreement between two $I(E)$ curves can also be
achieved by qualitatively very different curves. We present a modified $R$
factor $R_\mathrm{S}$, which can be used as a direct replacement for
$R_\mathrm{P}$, but avoids these shortcomings. We also demonstrate that
$R_\mathrm{S}$ is as good as $R_\mathrm{P}$ or better in steering the
optimization to the correct result in the case of imperfections of the
experimental data, while another common $R$ factor, $R_\mathrm{ZJ}$ (suggested
by Zanazzi and Jona) is worse in this respect.

Abstract: Algorithms for computing neutrino oscillation probabilities in sharply

important. As the next generation of experiments, DUNE and HyperK as well as
the IceCube upgrade and KM3NeT, come online, the computational cost for
atmospheric and solar neutrinos will continue to increase. To address these
issues, we expand upon our previous algorithm for long-baseline calculations to
efficiently handle probabilities through the Earth for atmospheric, nighttime
solar, and supernova neutrinos. The algorithm is fast, flexible, and accurate.
It can handle arbitrary Earth models with two different schemes for varying
density profiles. We also provide a c++ implementation of the code called
NuFast-Earth along with a detailed user manual. The code intelligently keeps
track of repeated calculations and only recalculates what is needed on each
successive call which can also help provide significant speed-ups.

Abstract: Cosmological determinations of the number of relativistic neutrino species,
$N^{ }_{\rm eff}$, are becoming increasingly accurate, and further improvements
are expected both from CMB and BBN data. Given this context, we update the
evaluation of $N^{ }_{\rm eff}$ and the current entropy density via the
momentum-averaged approach. This allows for a numerically fast description of
neutrino decoupling, easily portable to an array of new physics scenarios. We
revisit all aspects of this approach, including collision terms with full
electron mass dependence, finite temperature QED corrections to the equation of
state, neutrino oscillations, and the modelling of neutrino ensembles with
effective chemical potentials. For integrated observables, our results differ
by less than $0.04\%$ from the solution of the momentum-dependent evolution
equation. We outline how to extend the approach to BSM settings, and will
highlight its power in Part II. To facilitate the practical implementation, we
release a Mathematica and Python code within nudec_BSM_v2, easily linkable to
BBN codes.

Abstract: Precision calculations in hadronic processes at high energy colliders are
crucial for improving the understanding of the standard phenomena as well as

contribution of $Z$ boson exchange, we show that the calculation of $S$ matrix
elements for this process simplifies to a great extent by using spinor-helicity

Abstract: Low mass particles with small electric charges can be produced abundantly in
large electric fields via the Schwinger effect. We study the production rate of
such particles inside the polar gap of nearby pulsars. After production they
are accelerated above MeV energies by the local electric fields. These
pulsar-produced millicharged particles can be detected at Earth in
low-threshold dark matter direct detection experiments. We find that the
current XENONnT data constrains millicharged particles produced in the Crab
pulsar to have charges less than $O(10^{-6})$ for sub-eV masses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We analyze the excesses at 95 GeV in the light Higgs-boson searches in the
di-photon decay channel reported by CMS and ATLAS, which combined are at the
level of three standard deviations and are compatible with the excess in the
$b\bar{b}$ final state observed at LEP, together with an excess in the
di-photon channel at around 152 GeV reported based on a sideband analysis. We
demonstrate that these excesses can be well described in a minimally extended
Georgi-Machacek (meGM) model. This is enabled by four key features of the meGM
model: (1) a natural prediction for scalar boson masses of $\lesssim$200 GeV
arising from the condition to describe both the Higgs boson signal at 125 GeV
and the excesses at 95 GeV, (2) the prediction for a doubly charged Higgs boson
that can potentially enhance the di-photon decay rates, (3) asymmetric $WW$ and
$ZZ$ couplings to neutral scalar bosons that are induced by mild custodial
symmetry breaking, and (4) the approximate preservation of the electroweak
$\rho$ parameter to be 1 at tree level. We show in our numerical analysis that
the meGM model naturally improves the fit to the LHC data around 152 GeV when
describing the excesses at 95 GeV. At the same time, the model also predicts
additional light CP-odd and charged scalar bosons that can be potentially
probed in future experiments, which motivates dedicated searches in the
upcoming LHC runs. We also present the results of sensitivity studies for the
95 and 125 GeV Higgs-boson couplings at the HL-LHC and future $e^+e^-$
colliders, which demonstrate very interesting prospects for probing the meGM
model at future colliders.

Abstract: We calculate inclusive $B$-meson decay rates in the Mesogenesis framework, a
model explaining baryogenesis and the existence of dark matter, using the Heavy
Quark Expansion (HQE), up to the dimension-six two-quark Darwin term. By
systematically studying the power-suppressed contributions, we identify regions
of parameter space where subleading terms exceed the leading contribution,
i.e., the free $b$-quark decay, highlighting the limits of the HQE in this BSM
scenario. This behavior is reminiscent of the Standard Model only under
artificially heavy charm masses, and can be used to study the HQE close to its
breakdown. We further update the lower bounds on the exclusive decay mode $B^+
\to p^+ \psi$ by incorporating the fully HQE-corrected inclusive width in the
ratio $\Gamma_{\mathrm{excl}}/\Gamma_{\mathrm{incl}}$. Extending the analysis
from total decay rates to the lifetime ratio $\tau(B_s)/\tau(B_d)$, we find no
additional constraints on the couplings beyond existing collider bounds,
consistent with analogous results for $\tau(B^+)/\tau(B_d)$. We further compare
the sensitivity of both lifetime ratios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM) phenomenology and cosmic inflation within a
unified framework based on a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge extension of the Standard
Model (SM). The associated dark gauge boson, namely the dark photon, serves as
a viable DM candidate, which we call dark photon dark matter (DPDM), whilst the
dark Higgs field drives inflation. We explore a low-reheating scenario where DM
production occurs during reheating, resulting in significant entropy dilution
of the DPDM abundance. Both weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and
feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) DM scenarios are explored, depending
on the dark gauge coupling strength. For FIMP-type DM, the entropy dilution
allows for stronger couplings whilst maintaining the correct relic abundance,
potentially bringing these candidates within the reach of current and
near-future detection experiments. Similarly, WIMP-type DM can be realised with
weaker couplings. We perform a comprehensive parameter scan incorporating
constraints from collider data, DM direct and indirect detection experiments,
and cosmological observations. Taking quantum corrections and running of the
couplings into account, we demonstrate that dark Higgs inflation yields
predictions for the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$
that are consistent with the Planck, BICEP/Keck, and ACT data. The nonminimal
coupling of the dark Higgs inflaton field to gravity is shown to be much
smaller than in the case of the SM Higgs inflation scenario, avoiding unitarity
concerns. We show that reheating temperatures as low as 1 GeV and 1 MeV can be
achieved through the decay and scattering processes of the inflaton,
respectively, with the latter allowing for larger Higgs mixing angles and
enhanced detection prospects. Our results establish that this minimal extension
successfully unifies DM physics with inflationary cosmology.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent CMS analyses report an excess in the diphoton-plus-$b \bar{b}$
channel, indicative of a heavy resonance around 650 GeV decaying into a
Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson and a lighter scalar near 95 GeV. The case
for a 95 GeV state is further supported by diphoton excesses observed by both
CMS and ATLAS, as well as a $b\bar{b}$ excess previously observed at the Large
Electron-Position collider. This study present a unified interpretation of
these anomalies within the framework of the General Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model that naturally accommodates a light
singlet-dominated $CP$-even scalar boson near 95 GeV and an heavier
doublet-like scalar boson near 650 GeV. Through a comprehensive scan of the
parameter space, we demonstrate that the model can explain these excesses at
$2\sigma$ level while satisfying constraints from the dark matter relic
density, direct detection experiments, the properties of the 125 GeV Higgs
boson, $B$-physics observables, and searches for electroweakinos at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). The interpretation features a Bino-dominated lightest
neutralino as the dark matter candidate, whose relic abundance is achieved
primarily via $A_s$ funnel annihilation or coannihilation with $\tilde{S}$-like
$\tilde{\chi}^0_2$s into $h_sA_H$ final states. Our findings provide clear
predictions for testing this scenario at the high-luminosity LHC and future
colliders.

Abstract: In this study, we employ a conventional deep neural network (NN) framework
integrated with physics-based constraints to predict charged hadron
multiplicity ($N_{\text{ch}}$) in heavy-ion collisions. The goal is to assess
the performance of a purely data-driven deep neural network in comparison to a
physics-informed neural network (PINN). To accomplish this, we have taken data
generated from the HYDJET++ model for testing and training purposes. We train
our neural network frameworks using the data of one million individual
$^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}+^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}$ collision events. Our PINN model
successfully extracts the hard-scattering fraction ($x$) by learning its
underlying relation from the event data. For further testing and comparison
with the conventional NN, we take data of
$^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}+^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}$ (isobar of Zr) and
$^{197}_{79}\text{Au}+^{197}_{79}\text{Au}$ collisions using the same
simulation model. We found that the NN model needs more time to train with
physics. However, once trained, the PINN model is capable of accurately
predicting data that it has not encountered during training, such as Au+Au
collision results. Especially in a region of sparse data corresponding to high
$N_{\text{ch}}$ in our study, PINN has a clear advantage over a simple NN.

Abstract: We explore the observational consequences of resonant particle production
during inflation, focusing on its impact on dark matter annihilation signals
today. A transient burst of particle production generates localised features in
the primordial power spectrum, enhancing the formation of compact small-scale
dark matter structures known as prompt cusps. If dark matter consists of
thermal WIMPs, the resulting small-scale structures substantially boost
annihilation rates, leaving potentially detectable imprints in gamma-ray
observations. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data targeting the Virgo cluster, we
derive upper limits on the thermally averaged annihilation cross section
$\langle \sigma v \rangle$, connecting inflationary particle production in the
early universe with present-day observations constraining dark matter
annihilation.

Abstract: The weak interactions of neutrinos with other Standard Model particles are
well described within the Standard Model of particle physics. However, modern
accelerator-based neutrino experiments employ nuclei as targets, where
neutrinos interact with bound nucleons, turning a seemingly simple electroweak
process into a complex many-body problem in nuclear physics. At the time of
writing this Encyclopedia of Particle Physics chapter, neutrino-nucleus
interactions remain one of the leading sources of systematic uncertainty in
accelerator-based neutrino oscillation measurements.
  This chapter provides a pedagogical overview of neutrino interactions with
nuclei in the medium-energy regime, spanning a few hundred MeV to several GeV.
It introduces the fundamental electroweak formalism, outlines the dominant
interaction mechanisms - including quasielastic scattering, resonance
production, and deep inelastic scattering - and discusses how nuclear effects
such as Fermi motion, nucleon-nucleon correlations, meson-exchange currents,
and final-state interactions modify observable cross sections. The chapter also
presents a brief survey of the foundational and most widely used theoretical
models for neutrino-nucleus cross sections, together with an overview of
current and upcoming accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments that
are shaping the field.
  Rather than targeting experts, this chapter serves as a primer for advanced
undergraduates, graduate students, and early-career researchers entering the
field. It provides a concise foundation for understanding neutrino-nucleus
scattering, its relevance to oscillation experiments, and its broader
connections to both particle and nuclear physics.

Abstract: We present a novel robust framework for systematically constructing
D-dimensional four-point higher-derivative contact amplitudes. Our modular
block ("LEGO"-like) approach builds amplitudes directly from manifestly
gauge-invariant kinematic blocks, color-weight factors, and scalar Mandelstam
polynomials. Symmetries (Bose/Fermi) are imposed algebraically, acting as
filters on combinations of compatible pieces. This framework operates entirely
in D dimensions, naturally incorporating evanescent operators crucial for
loop-level consistency. Scaling to arbitrary mass dimension is achieved in a
highly controlled manner using permutation-invariant scalar polynomials,
avoiding combinatorial explosion. A key feature is its manifest compatibility
with the double-copy program, allowing the systematic generation of operator
towers not only for gauge theories but also for gravity and other theories
within the double-copy web.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Superallowed ($0^+\rightarrow0^+$) beta decays currently provide the most
precise extraction of quark mixing in the Standard Model. Their interpretation
as a measurement of $|V_{ud}|$ relies on a reliable first-principles
computation of QED radiative corrections expressed as a series in $Z\alpha$ and
$\alpha$. In this work, we provide the first model-independent result for
two-loop, $O(Z\alpha^2)$, long-distance radiative corrections where the nuclei
are treated as heavy point-like particles.
  We use renormalization group analysis to obtain new results at $O(Z\alpha^3)$
for the coefficient of double-logarithms in the ratio of the maximal beta
energy to the inverse nuclear size, $\Em/R^{-1}$. We use the
Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem to obtain new results at $O(Z^2\alpha^3)$ for
the coefficient of logarithms in the ratio of maximal beta energy to the
electron mass, $\log(2\Em/\me)$. We identify a structure-dependent, and
therefore short-distance, contribution to the traditional $Z\alpha^2$
correction that should be revisited.. We provide the first comprehensive update
to the long-distance corrections in almost forty years and comment on the
impact of our findings for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. We find that shifts in
the long-distance corrections are $2.5\times$ larger than past estimates of
their uncertainty, $1.5\times$ larger than the statistical uncertainty from the
combined fit of superallowed decays, and about $1/2$ the size of estimated
systematic error, which stems dominantly from nuclear structure effects.

Abstract: We compute $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ radiative corrections to superallowed
$\beta$ decays with a heavy-particle effective field theory that systematically
describes the interactions of low-energy ultrasoft photons with nuclei. We
calculate two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes by reducing the
Feynman integrals to a set of master integrals, which we solve analytically
using a variety of techniques. These techniques can be applied to other
phenomenologically interesting observables. The ultrasoft corrections can then
be combined with contributions arising from the exchange of potential photons
to obtain the complete $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ correction to the decay rate,
with resummation of large logarithms of the electron energy times the nuclear
radius. We find that $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loops induce a relative
correction to the decay rate that ranges from $0.7 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay
of $^{10}$C to $3.6 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{54}$Co, and will thus
impact the extraction of $V_{ud}$ at the permille level. We show that the
inclusion of these corrections reduces the residual renormalization scale
dependence of the decay rate to a negligible level, making missing ultrasoft
perturbative corrections a subdominant source of theoretical error.

Abstract: Designing metamaterials for extreme mechanical behavior involves the optimal
selection of design parameters. However, identifying these optimal parameters
through topology optimization (TO) across a large parametric space requires
extensive computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel deep learning framework for metamaterial topology optimization using an
enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) approach. Generating low-resolution
topologies significantly reduces computational cost compared to high-resolution
designs. Therefore, an EDSR network is trained to learn the mapping between
low- and high-resolution metamaterial topologies. The training dataset is
generated using solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP)-based TO. We
demonstrate the proposed approach for the design of mechanical metamaterials
targeting objectives such as maximization of bulk modulus, shear modulus, and
elastic modulus, and minimization of Poisson's ratio. Quantitative assessments
-including (i) pixel value error, (ii) objective function error, (iii)
intersection over union, and (iv) volume fraction error -validate the accuracy
of the EDSR-based TO. Our framework predicts high-resolution topologies of size
$192 \times 192$ from optimized low-resolution topologies of size $48 \times
48$. Once trained, the proposed network predicts these high-resolution
topologies with only $5-7\%$ of the computational cost required by conventional
SIMP-based TO at the same resolution. Moreover, by adding upscale blocks, the
framework can generate smoother, higher-resolution topologies suitable for 3D
printing. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution with strong
potential for multidisciplinary metamaterial design applications.

Abstract: Lithium-Sulfur batteries (LSBs) are believed to have a high potential for
aerospace applications due to their high gravimetric energy density. However,
despite decades of research and advances, they still suffer from poor rate
capability and low power output, eventually preventing their practical
implementation. One particular aspect we want to shed light on is the influence
of the porous cathode structure on the rate performance during discharge.
Therefore, we present a scale-resolved simulation methodology that aims to
provide structural insights into the electrochemical cell behavior that are
experimentally hardly accessible even for modern operando methods. Our
numerical operando approach employs high-performance computing (HPC) and is
based on a coarse-grained continuum model. The latter is spatially discretized
with a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and advanced in time by an adaptive
controller. The models and methods as well as HPC aspects of our toolbox will
be critically discussed, finally showcasing the capabilities of our workflow to
improve LSBs.

Abstract: Reliable control of skyrmion lifetime is essential for realizing spintronic
devices, yet the role of higher-order exchange - which can lead to skyrmion
stabilization - remains largely unexplored. Here we calculate lifetimes of
isolated skyrmions and antiskyrmions at transition-metal interfaces based on an
atomistic spin model that includes all fourth-order exchange terms. Within
harmonic transition-state theory, we evaluate both energetic and entropic
contributions and find substantially enhanced lifetimes when higher-order
exchange is included. The four-spin four-site interaction raises the energy
barrier and lowers the curvature of the energy landscape at the collapse saddle
point, increasing the pre-exponential factor. We show that skyrmions and
antiskyrmions can remain thermally stable even without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), and that tuning the four-spin term by a small amount
modulates the prefactor over orders of magnitude. Our results identify
higher-order exchange as a promising route to stabilize topological magnetic
textures - in particular in systems lacking DMI - and to engineer their
thermally activated decay.

Abstract: A comprehensive $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study, combined
with thermodynamic measurements and first-principle band-structure
calculations, has been conducted to explore the ground state of the $S = 5/2$
double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$. Our experimental
results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional
three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid
state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)].
Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below
$T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin
relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic
temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex
magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics.
Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of
strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate
from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic
frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family
of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing
and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising
platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.

Abstract: The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse
magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique
atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring
macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport
properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The
quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the
directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and
quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with
the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining
the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the
Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found
that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the
quantized energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in
LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum,
the energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR.
Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model
could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The
present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.

Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization

in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$
accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the
typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb
magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an
antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers,
rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding
reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for
Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission
electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault

Abstract: Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and
controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms.
We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS)
emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS
form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants
and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice.
Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact
expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the
topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy
matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct
compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which
enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our
results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter
and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: We provide here a study of some competing ordering tendencies exhibited by
the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice. To
this end, we investigate the interplay between superconductivity,
charge-density wave (CDW) and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of
interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain. As a
result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for
intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied
magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent
emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional
PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW.
These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform
in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of
charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with
strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of
the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the
properties of realistic strongly correlated systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Exact results are presented for itinerant systems
  demonstrating that the nearest neighbor Coulomb
  repulsion (V) destroys the homogeneity in the high concentration regime, this
  property being not present in the low concentration domain. Since the effects
  of V often seems contradictory, and the number of phases in which it could
  appear is extremely large, this result underlines that the action of the
  nearest neighbor repulsion is not necessarily routed in the characteristics
  of phases on which it acts, but could be intimately related to V itself.
  The $V > 0$ case usually means non-integrability, hence the deduced exact
  ground states are related to non-integrable systems, the technique being
  based on positive semidefinite operator properties.

Abstract: We propose a framework for applying on-shell scattering amplitude methods to
emergent relativistic phases of quantum matter. Many strongly correlated
systems, from Dirac and Weyl semimetals to topological-insulator surfaces,
exhibit low-energy excitations that are effectively massless relativistic
spinors. We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall
responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the
complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the
nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd
three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of
amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.

Abstract: The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block
element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of
flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent
phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet,
5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$
members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which
crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type
structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within
the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the
average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the
Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by
its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$
K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic
magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant
uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior
of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in
other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic
ground state across the material family.

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure
marks a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Motivated by the
recent experimental reports, we study an 11-band Hubbard model with
tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, by using large scale determinant quantum Monte
Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches. Our results
demonstrate that the major antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in
thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ can be significantly weaker than in the bulk at
29.5 Gpa. The out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between
Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is significantly reduced by about 27% in film,
whereas, the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unchanged. We
estimate the antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\parallel}$ and
$J_{\perp}$ by using perturbation theory. Regarding charge transfer, we find
that biaxial compression in the thin films results in reduced charge-transfer
gap compared to the bulk material. We determine the distribution of doped holes
and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) orbitals
and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals. A significant
particle-hole asymmetry regarding carrier doping is revealed. Our results
provide a foundation for subsequent studies of the low-energy $t-J$ model of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, and ofer key insights into the understanding of
physical differences between the film and bulk bilayer nickelate
high-temperature superconductors.

Abstract: Although BCS wave function for superconductors under periodic boundary
conditions are well-established, obtaining an explicit form of the many-body
BCS wave function under open boundary condition is usually a nontrivial
problem. In this work, we construct the exact BCS ground state wave function of
a one-dimensional spin-1/2 superconductor with $p+ is$ pairing symmetry under
open boundary conditions for special sets of parameters. The spin magnetization
on the edges are calculated explicitly using the obtained wave function.
Approximate expression of the wave function is also discussed based on
degenerate perturbation theory when the $s$-wave component is much smaller than
the $p$-wave one, which provides more intuitive understanding for the system.
Our work is useful for obtaining deeper understandings of open $p+ is$
superconducting chains on a wave function level.

Abstract: We study the interplay between altermagnetism and unconventional
superconductivity for the case of two-dimensional square- and
triangular-lattice systems. Our approach is based on an effective single
particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic
for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the
model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the
coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of
inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations
show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting
and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi
surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant
non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally
proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing
symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with
singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper
pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector
mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result
in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode.

Abstract: Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the
insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors,
superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually
suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms
when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine
electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of
cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping
levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level,
accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in
electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along
the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in
hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of
the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes
into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations
replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped
cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2
AFM Mott insulators.

Uncertainty Index and BRICS exchange rates, we investigate their extreme tail
dependence within an original time-varying copula framework. Our analysis makes
several noteworthy results. Evidence for Indian, Russian and South African
currencies indicates an elliptical copulas' dominance implying neither
asymmetric features nor extreme movements in their dependence structure with
the global economic uncertainty. Importantly, Brazilian and Chinese currencies
tail dependence is upward trending suggesting a safe-haven role in times of
high global economic uncertainty including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In
such circumstances, these markets offer opportunities to significant gains
through portfolio diversification.

Abstract: We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire
patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we
drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order.
Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while
spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands
with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with
electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific
twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates
that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the
realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures
with geometries that were previously inaccessible.

Abstract: We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect
in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator.
By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary
modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this
breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic
boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal
single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and
energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions
can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations
to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.

Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, long hypothesised as fundamental particles carrying
isolated magnetic charge, emerge in spin-ice systems as fractionalised
excitations governed by the ice rule. Yet their three-dimensional field
structure has never been directly visualised. Here, we use two-photon
lithography and processing to fabricate a fully three-dimensional artificial
spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry. We then use scanning
nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of
both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. We find that ice-rule vertices
produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilised by the
local frustrated two-in/two out ordering principle. Direct imaging of the
monopole stray field shows a highly divergent profile. By correlating
experiment with micromagnetic simulations and performing a multipole expansion
of the reconstructed magnetisation, we reveal that monopoles in 3DASI are
non-trivial micromagnetic entities, carrying both magnetic charge and an
intrinsic moment, giving rise to anisotropic interactions that are dependent
upon the quasiparticles position on the lattice. Results suggest that as
monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their
interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, revealing
that monopole coupling is tunable through geometry, being set by the local
vertex topology. These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic
metamaterial in which nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of
emergent magnetic charges.

Abstract: We report the discovery of an in plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer
magnetic topological insulators, characterized by a quantized longitudinal
conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields. This state emerges
at a quantum critical point separating quantum anomalous Hall phases tuned by
field angle and orientation, directly linking gap-closing behavior to quantized
criticality. Temperature and gate dependent transport measurements, supported
by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles
dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of
impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings
establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics
with universal conductivity, offering both microscopic insight into critical
transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing
quantum criticality in topological systems.

Abstract: The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum
dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice
nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon
pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet
exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a
function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is
intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as
self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape
anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a
possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine
interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and
electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate
limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum
dots.

Abstract: We compute and analyze the dependence of excitonic second- and third-harmonic
generation (SHG/THG) as a function of the optical excitation intensity in the
presence of static electric fields by solving the semiconductor Bloch
equations. Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound
intralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane
electric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s
K-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of
the static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently
intense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases
superlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton
ionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that
these dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including
static and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark
localization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference
between optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration. Our
findings offer several new possibilities for controlling the strong-field
dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons.

Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their
intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely
unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a
multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the
altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin
precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This
altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall
voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the
spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the
proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor.
The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and
crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of
altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but
also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics
with practical spintronic applications.

Abstract: We investigate quantum fluctuation effects arising from the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle governing angular momentum operators in the full
dynamical evolution of disentanglement-entanglement-disentanglement between
itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments under the s-d exchange
interaction. Beyond the conventional deterministic spin-transfer torque, we
identify an intrinsic channel for the transfer of spin quantum fluctuations. By
extending the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include both quantum and
thermal stochastic fields, we reveal a temperature regime where quantum
fluctuations dominate spin dynamics. Furthermore, voltage-controlled magnetic
anisotropy can exponentially amplify these quantum fluctuation signals,
enabling their binary detection via tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic
tunnel junctions. These results establish a microscopic framework for quantum
fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and provide a fundamental route toward
spin-based quantum true random number generation.
