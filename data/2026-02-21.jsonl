The full RMM encodes detailed pairwise correlations among jets, b-jets, leptons, photons, and missing transverse energy but contains more than a thousand values per event, making it computationally heavy for large-scale training and incompatible with current low-qubit quantum devices. The proposed RMM-C46 input space for ML preserves the physical block structure of the RMM through aggregated invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components, reducing the size of the original RMM by over an order of magnitude while maintaining interpretability. Applied to simulated proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, these representations match or exceed the discriminative performance of the full RMM in both supervised and unsupervised ML tasks. Their compactness, stability, and physics transparency also make them naturally compatible with near-term quantum machine learning architectures. RMM-C46 provides a scalable, efficient, and quantum-ready alternative to the full RMM for next-generation collider physics analyses."}
