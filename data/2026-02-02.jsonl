Monolayer ice phases are well established on hydrophilic surfaces, where strong water-substrate interactions stabilize ordered hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, their formation on hydrophobic metals has been deemed ther-modynamically unfavourable, with water typically assembling into amorphous films, three-dimensional crystallites, or interlocked bilayer ice. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a monolayer ice phase on the hydrophobic Au(111) surface using a low-energy-electron-assisted growth method. Combined experimental characterizations including low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by first-principles calculations, prove that the monolayer ice phase composes of intact water molecules. This approach provides a generalizable strategy for stabilizing ordered two-dimensional ice on inert substrates and offers new insight into the interplay between water and low-energy electrons at hydrophobic interfaces."}

Graphene serves as a prominent van der Waals template for molecular self-assembly; however, graphene on SiC is intrinsically heterogeneous, with decoupled monolayer graphene coexisting with residuals of a covalently bound buffer layer, which may affect molecular ordering. Here, we track the ordering of the molecular donor, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexamethoxytriphenylene (HMTP), from the first layer to thin films, combining low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction with X-ray diffraction. HMTP forms highly ordered epitaxial layers on single-layer graphene, whereas growth on the buffer layer initiates as amorphous and evolves into polycrystalline films with weak orientation with respect to the substrate. Crucially, hydrogen intercalation decouples the buffer layer, converting it into quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene and restoring epitaxial growth. These findings demonstrate that interfacial coupling governs molecular epitaxy on graphene/SiC, and interface engineering via hydrogen intercalation provides a scalable route to control organic thin-film crystallinity on graphene."}

The intense electromagnetic fields generate high rates of photonuclear interactions, including events involving multiple photon exchange. Multiple photon exchange can result in the production of multiple vector mesons and/or nuclear excitations. These interactions share a common impact parameter, so the photons have the same linear polarization. The shared polarization entangles the particles, leading to unique quantum correlations. The decays of these vector excitations are sensitive to this polarization, allowing for the study of these correlations.\n  This letter will compare classical and quantum calculations of the correlations between these azimuthal directions. The two approaches predict vert different angular correlations. The differences are akin to those seen with polarized photons in tests of Bells inequality. Uniquely, UPC photoproduction can produce final states containing three or more particles, all entangled with the same polarization. These more complex states exhibit additional unique phenomenology, allowing new tests of multi-particle entanglement."}

Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape.

We find that the relative twist between polygons induces noncollinear chiral phases, ranging from flux vortex closure to hedgehog like radial configurations. Chirality, quantified in terms of a bond order parameter, is an emergent property that behaves here as an Ising variable. The chiral configurations of the systems can be understood in terms of chirality and clock index order parameters, whose evolution with twist occurs through two types of first order phase transitions. Within a fixed Ising chiral sector, the clock index, rooted in the $C_N$ invariance of the polygons, characterizes chiral textures that share chirality. As the twist increases, it continuously shifts the preferred relative clock phase, but the Nfold anisotropy only allows discrete orientations; the competition produces a tilted Nfold energy landscape whose global minimum hops discontinuously between clock sectors. As the number of sites in the polygon grows, the resulting response displays a nonlinear crossover from rigid, Ising like behavior to an almost $\\rm U(1)$ invariant regime, governed by a twist induced suppression of the emergent $Z_N$ clock anisotropy. A Landau phenomenology captures these trends and naturally extends to bilayer lattices, where we show that twisted honeycomb systems realize an effective sine-Gordon theory with twist-controlled transitions between isolated domain walls and domain wall lattices."}

Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $π$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $π$-rings."}

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction.

Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation.

This then yields an exactly solvable model for studying the sign problem where the Path Integral Monte Carlo energy at any time step for any number of fermions is known analytically, or can be computed numerically. It is found that repulsive/attractive pairwise interaction shifts the sign problem to larger/smaller imaginary time, but does not make it more severe than the non-interacting case. More surprisingly, for closed-shell number of fermions, the sign problem goes away at large imaginary time. Fourth-order and newly found variable-bead algorithms are used to compute ground state energies of quantum dots with up to 110 electrons and compared to results obtained by modern neural networks."}

Here we apply a correlative scanning transmission electron microscopy approach that enables simultaneous mapping of lattice structure, crystallographic orientation, and phase distribution at 10 nanometre resolution in a medium-manganese TRIP steel. We combine nano-beam electron diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps to characterize an industrial medium-manganese steel containing 7.15 weight percent Mn. Tensile testing of a rolled steel sample was performed, and lamellae were extracted from deformed and undeformed regions. Manganese-resolved energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provides a chemical fingerprint that, when combined with nano-beam electron diffraction based phase segmentation, enables robust ferrite-martensite separation and phase-resolved lattice-parameter refinement. The phase fractions of ferrite, austenite, and martensite are quantified together with their corresponding lattice parameters, accompanied by measurable shifts in grain-size distributions and crystallographic texture in the deformed regions. Kernel average misorientation maps reveal systematically lower local misorientation in ferrite than in martensite.

The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime.

Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths > 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 μeV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs.

However, a central challenge in the PS process lies in achieving precise control over thermal self-stabilization in the presence of complex microstructural effects arising from photonic-ray--induced thermal profiles. To elucidate the interplay among thermal fields, microstructural evolution, and PS process parameters, this study establishes a two-scale, non-isothermal simulation framework. The framework integrates macroscopic heat-transfer simulations, incorporating effective heat conduction and photonic-ray--induced volumetric heating in the porous media, with microscopic non-isothermal phase-field sintering simulations that resolve microstructure evolution under local thermal profile. Scale bridging is achieved through a temperature field transferring and mapping that satisfies Hill-Mandel condition between the macroscopic and microscopic simulations, while maintaining synchronization between their asynchronous time-stepping schemes. After calibrating model parameters against experimental measurements, the framework successfully reproduces the experimentally observed porosity inhomogeneity along the sample depth. The influence of enhanced localized mass transport is further examined through a parametric investigation of surface and grain boundary diffusivities. Overall, the proposed framework demonstrates its feasibility and physical interpretability in establishing process-microstructure relationships for the scalable fabrication of high-performance protonic ceramics."}

We develop a continuum model for the shrinking dynamics of antiskyrmions in bulk DMI systems, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the time derivative of the magnetization field. Owing to the structure of their azimuthal angle, or helicity, elliptic antiskyrmions are energetically favored over circular ones. To capture this feature, we parametrize the magnetization field with a triangular radial profile and an elliptic in-plane shape. This ansatz yields four coupled dynamical equations governing time evolution of the semi-axes, helicities, and rotation angles. In the absence of the DMI, circular antiskyrmions shrink isotropically, exhibiting a crossover from exponential decay to square-root collapse. Initially elliptic antiskyrmions are driven towards circularity. For finite DMI, the semi-axes dynamics couples to the helicity and rotation, where the theory predicts a rotation angle following by half of the slope of the helicity evolution which is linear in time. Only at small semi-axes a cross-over to a logarithmic divergence occurs. The shrinking dynamics of the antiskyrmion size is found to be accompanied by quadrupole-like oscillations. Numerical simulations on the lattice support the predictions from the continuum model."}

In the isotropic case ($Δ=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $Δ$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $Δ$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model."}

These distorted amorphous interfacial regions exhibit markedly enhanced Li+ hopping activity, significantly outperforming the bulk lattice, provided that local mobile Li+ inventory is not depleted by surface charge redistribution.

However, the contribution from tree-level mechanisms alone to the branching ratio of $Ω^- \\to Ξ^- π^0$ is small due to its color-suppressed nature. The discrepancy is resolved by including final state interactions through rescattering processes via intermediate states $Ξ^0π^-$ and $ΛK^-$. This work demonstrates that a unified description of $Ω^-$ hadronic weak decays necessitates the interplay of quark-level weak vertices, baryon pole structures, and long-distance final state rescattering dynamics. With these mechanisms, the obtained branching ratios are in agreement with the high-precision experimental data from the BESIII.

Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials."}

It is, however, still poorly understood how the THz emission amplitude and its bandwidth can be optimized. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the THz emission from various magnetic heterostructures. The dynamics of the spin current is described by the semiclassical, superdiffusive spin-transport model and the energy dependence of the spin Hall effect of hot electrons is taken into account, leading to emission profiles for Co(2 nm)/Pt(4 nm) bilayer in good agreement with experiment. To identify the optimal {conditions} for THz emission, {we study} the properties of the emitted THz wave profile by systematically varying the layer thicknesses of metallic bilayers, their interfacial spin-current transmission properties, their materials' dependence, and influence of the pump laser-pulse width, allowing us to give optimization guidelines. We find that thin nonmagnetic layer thicknesses of 5-6 nm provide the largest bandwidth in the case of Co/Pt and that the peak frequency of the THz emission depends only on the geometry of the emitter and not on the laser pulse width. The THz bandwidth {is conversely found to} depend on several factors such as exciting laser pulse width, layers' thicknesses, and interface transmission-reflection properties, with the limitation that an increase in the bandwidth by tuning the interface properties comes with a trade-off in the energy efficiency of the emitter. Lastly, we propose a double pulse excitation protocol of a trilayer system that could provide broadband THz emission with a large bandwidth. {Our results contribute to establishing guidelines for optimizing spintronic THz generation."}

In this setup, a quantum point contact bends a single edge into a loop, where tunneling occurs at the open end and is controlled by the QPC voltage. In contrast with previously studied two-edge geometries, the weak backscattering regime is dominated by the first-order perturbative term, allowing quantum transport quantities to factorize into a non-universal prefactor and a braiding-induced contribution that provides direct access to the universal statistical angle $πλ$. While previous analyses neglected edge-to-edge capacitance, we show that capacitive effects, which are known to play a crucial role in mesoscopic capacitors, modify both the current and the current cross-correlations. Using a two-point Green's function formalism augmented by Dyson's equation to include the charging energy, we quantify how the fluctuations of the cross-correlations depend simultaneously on $λ$ and on the capacitance of the loop. Our results indicate that a reliable extraction of the statistical angle requires a parallel measurement of the loop capacitance, which can be implemented via a charged gate coupled to the junction."}

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering."}

Monte Carlo simulations reveal significant spin fluctuations, spin-spin correlations and an absence of conventional magnons in such anomalous state; while the response of the anomalous state to perturbation is found to be akin to an overdamped forced oscillator. We find close relation of such state to the correlated ``director'' state in the material.

Exotic colored fermions and scalars mediate radiative neutrino mass generation at the one loop-level. The PQ charge assignment forbids tree-level neutrino masses and leaves a residual $Z_3$ symmetry that ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos. In the minimal realization, the neutrino mass matrix is of rank two, predicting one massless neutrino. Consequently, the sum of neutrino masses is constrained for both the normal and inverted hierarchies. We analyze the implications for charged lepton flavor violation and the lepton $g-2$. The axion emerging from this framework dynamically resolves the strong CP problem and accounts for the observed dark matter abundance. Notably, the predicted axion-photon coupling is within reach of upcoming experiments and consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological bounds."}

The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment.

This is an important gap in knowledge as dislocations cannot be avoided at interfaces and can also be engineered by plastic deformation at high temperatures. Using atomistic simulations, we show how the cores of $\\langle100\\rangle$ edge dislocations in BaTiO$_3$ can either act as nucleation centers for ferroelectric switching or pin walls depending on the direction of the applied field.

Sensor sensitivity can be enhanced by lowering the effective anisotropy field; however, this favors magnetic domain formation during magnetization reversal, leading to hysteretic responses. Therefore, precise control of magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal is essential to balance sensitivity and stability in PHE sensors. In this work, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal mechanisms of Ni-Fe- and Co-Fe-based multilayers grown on various metallic buffer layers and deposited with and without an external magnetic field, in order to evaluate the effects of the buffer layers and field-assisted deposition on the resulting magnetic anisotropy. NiFe films exhibit a dominant uniaxial anisotropy mainly determined by the applied field during growth, with an anisotropy constant of approximately $3,\\mathrm{kerg,cm^{-3}}$, largely independent of the buffer layer. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy of CoFe films is dominated by the buffer layer, resulting in a biaxial magnetic response. In particular, Ag-buffered films deposited under an external magnetic field exhibit a biaxial anisotropy with values up to $14.88,\\mathrm{kerg,cm^{-3}}$. The magnetization reversal mechanism of each system was deduced from the analysis of the angular dependence of the coercive field."}

As they propagate through the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma, medium-induced interactions lead to path-length dependent depolarization, imprinting an azimuthally anisotropic polarization pattern. Within the framework of rotational Brownian motion, we show that the resulting polarization harmonics are directly related to the initial spatial eccentricities, thereby establishing heavy-flavor polarization anisotropies as a sensitive and complementary probe of the early-time collision geometry.

The absorption increase is directly related to the ionization of the Si donor and Mg acceptor levels, which are controlled by the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels. It is shown that the absorption may be increased because of the higher ionization of Mg caused by the compensation in the p-type region and the high ionization of Si in the n-type region.

Mesons and baryons are modeled as open relativistic strings with quark-antiquark and quark-diquark endpoints, respectively, leading to an exponential Hagedorn growth of states with a limiting temperature fixed by the string tension. We find that continuous Hagedorn spectra constrained by experimentally established hadrons underestimate net-baryon number fluctuations obtained in lattice QCD calculations. By extracting the Hagedorn string spectrum directly from lattice QCD through a fit to the second-order net-baryon number susceptibility, we obtain a consistent description of a broad set of fluctuations of conserved charges from LQCD with the Hagedorn temperature $T_H \\simeq 323~$MeV, without introducing additional free parameters. Our results provide thermodynamic evidence in support of a string quark-diquark picture of baryons in the confined phase of QCD."}

However, as non-Hermitian systems typically contain more degrees of freedom, this poses a challenge for analytical approaches to understand their topology and invariants. In this work, we analytically calculate the 2D Zak phase for a 2D non-Hermitian SSH-type Hamiltonian that supports a rich structure and edge currents. Closed-form expressions for eigenstates and divisions of the phase diagram are obtained, including for regions in the phase diagram where different types of exceptional points exist. We use Morse theory to determine the topology of exceptional points in momentum space. Although the band structure breaks down at exceptional points, we show that a specific phase-based topological invariant remains well-defined. Furthermore, our work yields an analytic derivation for counting edge states in the Hermitian limit.

Calculations were used to obtain the equilibrium state of the hydrogen atom deep in the GaN bulk and at the GaN(0001) surface. It was shown that the H position within bulk GaN depends on the Fermi level: in n-type GaN, it is located in the channel, whereas in p-type GaN, it is attached to the N atom, breaking one of the GaN bonds. In contrast, at the GaN(0001) surface, H is attached in the on-top position for any hydrogen coverage; for low and high H-coverage, the Fermi level is pinned at the Ga - broken bond state and at the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively. The diffusion path from the bulk to the surface was obtained when the Fermi level was high and low, the barrier was zero, and $ΔE_{bar} \\approx 1.717 eV$, which effectively blocked hydrogen escape into the vapor. Thus, high H coverage, that is, high hydrogen pressure in the vapor, prevents H from escaping from the bulk to the surface, whereas at low coverage (low hydrogen pressure), the process is barrierless. It is therefore proven that the hydrogen escape control step in the Nakamura process is the transition of hydrogen from the bulk to the surface, which is controlled by the position of the Fermi level at the surface. Molecular hydrogen desorption from the surface is easy for high H coverage and difficult for low, thus opposite to observed experimentally thus this process is not the determining step in activation. A full thermodynamic estimate of the maximal partial pressure of hydrogen in the vapor, corresponding to the transition of the Fermi level from the Ga-broken bond state to the VBM, was used to establish the maximal hydrogen pressure limit for the p-type Mg activation process."}

The subtraction terms are all based on the well-understood process of single-Higgs production. The core of our subtraction scheme relies on achieving local factorization in all infrared limits of real and virtual momenta. This necessitates systematic modifications of the original Feynman integrand for loop amplitudes, enabling gauge symmetry cancellations before performing integrations. Our approach provides an essential step toward NNLO cross-section calculations for hadron collider processes, where both loop and phase-space integrations are carried out numerically."}

Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen."}

In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $π$-rings."}

Liquid phase chemical functionalization is governed by liquid solid interfaces.

To elucidate pathways for functionalizing nanoscale metals, it is crucial to measure the distribution of species, including light elements, across the liquid solid interface, capturing both reactants and products. Here, we employ cryogenic atom probe tomography to directly analyse frozen liquid solid reaction interfaces at near atomic resolution. Focusing on the interaction of iodide and sodium ions with nanoporous gold, we observe the formation of iodine containing complexes on gold nanoligament surfaces and subsurfaces. These findings reveal aspects of the gold iodide system that were previously hidden, including the reaction mechanism between iodide and gold atoms on the surface, and the multiple gold iodide complexes forming. Our work demonstrates that cryogenic atom probe tomography can provide unprecedented visualisation and characterisation of nanoscale interfaces during chemical and electrochemical reactions, with potential implications for modern manufacturing, energy technologies, and sustainable materials development."}

Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $π$-rings."}

The experimental investigation of strain-induced effects at the nanoscale is of importance not only for its fundamental aspect, but also for the development of device applications. Transmission X-ray microscopy is a particularly well-suited technique for the nanoscale imaging of magnetic materials, but its compatibility with in-situ mechanical straining of samples is limited. In this work, we present a setup for applying tailored in-situ mechanical strains to freestanding thin films by means of a micro electromechanical system (MEMS) actuator. We then present a proof-of-concept experiment where a freestanding 80 nm thick (001) BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic thin film is strained with the MEMS device, allowing us to control the coupled ferroelectric/spin cycloidal configuration."}
