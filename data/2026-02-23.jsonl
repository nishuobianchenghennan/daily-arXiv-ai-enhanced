The models have new vector-like leptons and quarks, with mass mixings to each other and Yukawa couplings to light Standard Model fields encoded in \"chains\" reminiscent of dimensional deconstruction. Locality in the chains both generates the hierarchical Standard Model Yukawa matrices, and ensures that CP and flavor violating effects are small, even with the vector-like particles at the TeV scale. A simple extension also generates neutrino masses, whose tiny size is parametrically related to the square of the electron Yukawa coupling. We outline the essential features of these models, explain how fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles emerge, and explore their phenomenological implications. This framework can be tested both in the final run of the LHC as well as at possible future colliders operating at the 10 TeV scale, and we identify some of the distinctive experimental signatures associated with the production and decay of the new vector-like fermions."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Minimal electroweak dark matter models are compelling due to their simplicity, though calculations of their freezeout abundance are complicated by nonperturbative effects due to Sommerfeld enhancement and bound-state formation. It has been shown that all individual multiplet scenarios beyond the doublet lead to direct-detection signals above the neutrino floor and thus within the reach of next-generation experiments. If no signals are found, would minimal dark matter be excluded? Yes for the simplest models, but it has been unknown for the important extension of two multiplets coupled by Higgs interactions (Higgs-coupled minimal dark matter). We present a generalized framework for calculating nonperturbative effects for such models that also covers the case of individual multiplets. In this framework, we calculate nonperturbative effects on freezeout as well as the prospects for direct detection, correcting shortcomings and omissions in the literature. Importantly, for the mixed Majorana (odd) and Dirac (even) multiplet combinations 3M2D, 5M4D, and 7M6D, we find that the predicted direct-detection signals can extend below the neutrino floor. Fully testing minimal dark matter will thus require more than direct-detection experiments."}

The factorization formulae of the vacuum-to-$Λ_b$ correlation function, constructed from the interpolating current for the proton, are derived at leading power in $m_p / m_{Λ_b}$, using the method of regions. With our specific choice of interpolating current, only the twist-4 distribution amplitude of the $Λ_b$ baryon contributes to the form factors. Numerically, we find that the next-to-leading order QCD perturbative corrections reduce the tree-level form factors to approximately 65$\\%$ of their original value, with the next-to-leading-order jet function providing the dominant contribution.

The model contains two Majorana states $χ_1$ and $χ_2$ with $δ=M_{χ_2}-M_{χ_1}>0$ and $χ_1$ the dark matter candidate, and a dark photon $A^{\\prime}$ with mass $M_{A^{\\prime}}$. Our analysis represents an integration of existing ones, where only specific benchmarks of the A$^{\\prime}$iDM scenario have been discussed. In particular, we fix the $U(1)_D$ coupling $α_D$ equal to the electromagnetic one $α_{EM}$ and $ε$ to its experimental upper bound, and perform a complete scan of the remaining parameters $(M_{χ_1},δ, M_{A^{\\prime}})$, discussing the $χ_1$ relic abundance, its direct and indirect searches, as well as potential signals from astrophysics and accelerators. Our systematic scan shows that $α_D$ = $α_{EM}$ is not disfavored, as some previous analyses, limited to specific benchmarks, may suggest. We also find that when the $χ_1$ relic density matches observation direct and indirect searches are not kinematically accessible. On the other hand we find that the projected luminosity of FASER, a detector searching for Long Lived Particles (LLP) decay at the LHC, can probe or rule out the parameters space of the model for $M_{χ_1}\\lesssim$ 7 GeV, 100 MeV $\\lesssim δ\\lesssim$ 300 MeV and $M_{A^{\\prime}}\\lesssim$ 25 GeV.

It leverages a causal forest machine learning methodology to control for numerous confounding variables, enabling systematic analysis of heterogeneity and non-linearities often overlooked. A key innovation is the use of a pre-trained FinancialBERT to generate sentiment scores from quarterly reports, which are then treated as causal interventions impacting profitability dynamics like returns and volatilities. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from NEPSE, NRB, and individual financial institutions, the research employs SHAP analysis to identify influential profit predictors. A two-pronged causal analysis further explores how sentiment's impact is conditioned by Loan Portfolio/Asset Composition and Balance Sheet Strength/Leverage. Average Treatment Effect analyses, combined with SHAP insights, reveal statistically significant causal associations between certain balance sheet and expense management variables and profitability. This advanced causal machine learning framework significantly extends existing literature, providing a more robust understanding of how financial sentiment truly impacts firm performance."}

These topological ripples exhibit orientations unpinned to the crystal lattice, forming a nematic phase that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry. We attribute this instability to field-induced spatial variations of the spin texture driven by competing magnetic interactions.

We demonstrate T1 spin relaxometry from thousands of FNDs using an optimised cuvette-based system integrating an avalanche photodiode operated in linear mode, and a fast, fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) for data collation. We demonstrate chemical monitoring of the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) ions in-solution with a 15 second integration using an optimised T1 sensing protocol. Our method achieves more than two orders of magnitude speed up with an order of magnitude reduction in cost when compared with traditional techniques. With further technical improvements, we believe this in-solution method could be extended to sense the sub-second chemical kinetics of paramagnetic molecules in solution."}

However, predicting their mechanical behaviour remains challenging due to their structural complexity, multiscale features, and variability in material properties. This study presents a hierarchical approach to investigate fracture phenomena in both aligned and randomly oriented nanofibrous networks by integrating atomistic modelling and nonlocal continuum mechanics, namely peridynamics. At the nanoscale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are employed to apply tensile loads to freestanding pristine and silver-doped PLA nanofibres, where key mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and critical energy release rate are determined. A new method is introduced to transfer data from molecular dynamics to peridynamics by ensuring convergence of the tensile response of a single fiber in both frameworks. This nano-to-micro coupling technique is then used to examine the Young's modulus, fracture toughness in modes I and II, and crack propagation in PLA nanofibrous networks. The proposed framework can also incorporate the effects of surface coating and fiber arrangements on the measured properties. This research paves the way for the development of stronger and more durable eco-friendly nanofibrous networks with optimised performance."}

Drawing on a theoretical foundation of welfare economics, the article argues that the current reporting inversion -- where trade execution (Form 4) frequently precedes the public notice of intent (Form 144) -- violates the conditions for Pareto efficiency by inducing non-symmetric pricing. Utilizing an event-study framework of intent-to-sell windows, the analysis examines cases where insiders file a notice of proposed sale but fail to execute within the statutory 90-day period. The machine learning audit reveals a persistent 52.4 percent opacity rate, where aborted signals remain statistically indistinguishable from routine executions, creating a structural information ceiling that prevents the market from exhausting the signal's informational content. Contrary to the traditional small-firm effect, the study documents a large-cap significance paradox: while small-cap portfolios yield higher absolute abnormal returns (32.21 bps), statistically significant alpha is concentrated in large-cap firms (14.49 bps, $p = 0.021$). The results suggest that Institutional Salience enables more reliable processing of this negative non-event when reputational costs are maximized. Cross-sectional tests confirm that prior idiosyncratic volatility serves as a signal amplifier, with causal estimators identifying an illiquidity jump of up to 2.63 times. To mitigate this market failure, the study proposes a mandatory execution confirmation (Form 144-A) to transition the regime toward bilateral accountability, converting a predictive blind spot into a verifiable data stream and restoring the informational symmetry requisite for efficient capital allocation."}

In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded."}

At the charge-neutrality point, as the magnetic field increases, the local conductivity at the edge drops to zero more slowly than in the bulk. This behavior is consistent with the calculated spatial profile of the charge gap in the canted antiferromagnetic phase. For comparison, we also perform microwave imaging of integer quantum Hall states away from neutrality, which host dissipationless chiral edge channels. The evolution of the edge signal as a function of the bulk gap is fundamentally different between the Landau level filling factor $ν= 0$ and $|ν| \\ge 1$ integer quantum Hall states, which can be qualitatively explained by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis.

This acts as an ultrafast optoelectronic gate that drives momentum-dependent band renormalizations, resulting in a transient band-gap opening on femtosecond timescales. Simultaneously, the photogenerated hot-carrier population enhances electronic screening, leading to subsequent closing of the band-gap beyond the thermal equilibrium value. These findings reveal two different mechanisms for photoinduced, reversible control of the electronic band structure in bilayer graphene -- interlayer charge transfer and hot-carrier-enhanced screening -- providing a general framework for the ultrafast control of electronic properties in graphene-based heterostructures. This opens up novel pathways for the realization of ultrafast optoelectronic devices and the exploration of correlated quantum phases in bilayer graphene under non-equilibrium conditions."}

Recent experimental realization of metallenes in the Ångström limit has further intensified interest in this class of 2D materials.

Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing. Here, we address this gap by studying 45 elemental metallenes in six monolayer lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled forms) using density-functional theory. We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology). This score enables targeted angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) tests, controlled Lifshitz transitions, and provides a predictive basis for transport and device applications."}

These results provide design guidance for flux mitigation in superconducting integrated circuits and highlight the need for combined optimization of circuit geometries and materials."}

Exciton quantum beats observed in both Faraday and Voigt geometries offer a precise probe of the energy splittings among the four 1$s$ exciton states, enabling determination of the fine structure and bright-dark splittings.

In particular, it is sign-problem-free when we assume the widely used Millis-Monien-Pines form for the phenomenological susceptibility in the effective action of the fluctuating local moment, even though these local moments are now subjected to Landau damping as a result of their coupling to the itinerant quasiparticle on the fermi surface.

Both $σ^{xx}(ω)$ and $σ^{xy}(ω)$ calculated are found to exhibit a two-component structure, with a Drude component at low energy and a mid-infrared component at higher energy.

Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25°C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel. This unexpected result can prompt new ideas for topology-based circuit elements with extremely low losses and power consumption."}

Specifically, the formation of out-of-plane MXene (o-MXenes) with Mo segregation to outermost metallic layers (M') is only driven by the oxygen (O) termination at prismatic sites.

Dirac nodal arc semimetals characterized by ultrahigh carrier mobility with over 25000 cm2 V-1 s-1 offer a promising platform to search for efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that strategic Pt incorporation into PdSn4 optimizes the electronic structure and carrier dynamics of this Dirac semimetal. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the resulting Pd-Sn-Pt local electronic structure redistributes charge density around Pd and Pt atoms, which facilitates C-C coupling via *OC-COH and *OC-CHOH intermediates and enhances carrier mobility by 40% versus the pristine PdSn4 single crystal.

Using the on-shell scheme the parameters in the scalar sector can be fixed and expressed in terms of observed meson masses and decay constants. The remaining parameters can be varied. In the QMD models, all the symmetries are global, including the $SU(N_c)$ symmetry. The breaking of the global symmetries gives rise to a number of Goldstone bosons depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern, i.e. whether the system is in the 2SC phase or the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. This is in contrast to perturbative QCD, where some of the gauge bosons become massive via the Higgs mechanism. We classify the Goldstone bosons and show that their type and number are in accordance with general counting rules. The thermodynamic potential $Ω$ is calculated in the mean-field approximation, where we include quark loops, while mesons and diquarks are treated at tree level. As important applications, we study the properties of the pion-condensed phase at finite isospin chemical potential, and the 2SC and CFL phases at finite baryon chemical potential. We present a few numerical results focusing on the speed of sound, gaps, and condensates. It is shown that the BCS gaps approaches a constant for large isospin and baryon chemical potentials and that the speed of sound approaches the conformal value from above in the same limit."}

In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded."}

Irradiation adds further complications by generating defect clusters and transmutation products that alter both the driving forces and kinetics of grain boundary motion. In this work, we develop a physics-based, multiscale framework that couples crystal plasticity, stochastic cluster dynamics, and discrete grain boundary dynamics to model the co-evolution of plastic deformation, irradiation damage, and grain growth in fusion-grade tungsten polycrystals. The approach enables simulations on realistic microstructures with arbitrary grain size and misorientation distributions, without recourse to mean-field simplifications. The model captures (i) the spatial heterogeneity of dislocation density distribution during hot working; (ii) irradiation-induced defect accumulation under fusion conditions, and (iii) the buildup of chemical and elastic driving forces for grain boundary migration and microstructural evolution. Parametric studies demonstrate the dominant influence that temperature has on thermally activated grain-boundary mobility, a weaker dependence on prior strain, and a pronounced retardation of recrystallization by rhenium segregation arising from neutron transmutation. Under fusion energy irradiation conditions, our framework predicts a substantial reduction of the effective recrystallization temperature relative to unirradiated microstructures, while Re production restores and even elevates this limit. By providing quantitative projections of recrystallization kinetics and in-service recrystallization temperatures, this work establishes a predictive tool for assessing the lifetime and operational envelope of W-based plasma-facing materials under fusion conditions."}

We demonstrate that decoupled transfer learning-separating pretrained GNN feature extractors from simple regressors-overcomes this barrier. Pretrained features provide transferable structural knowledge, while simple regressors enable smooth extrapolation by maintaining learned trends beyond training boundaries. Benchmarked on layered intercalation compounds through four rigorous extrapolation scenarios and a temporal Materials Project split, our framework achieves 68% error reduction (RMSE: 0.881 vs. 2.778 eV/atom) versus end-to-end GNNs for extrapolation.

In this work, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Li+ by Na+ ions in the second coordination sphere of Eu3+ ions in LiYO2 enables a substantial shift of the phase transition temperature, thereby allowing controlled optimization of the thermometric performance. This approach represents a significantly more cost-effective and efficient strategy for tuning the phase transition temperature compared with the previously proposed substitution of Y3+ by other lanthanide ions. Importantly, we show that lowering the transition temperature through Na+ incorporation simultaneously introduces static compositional disorder and local lattice strain. As a consequence, the enthalpy difference between the competing structural phases decreases, and the cooperativity of the lattice distortion is reduced, indicating a gradual weakening of the first-order character of the phase transition. Our results demonstrate that such structural modifications, while effective in shifting the transition temperature, inevitably lead to a reduction in the relative sensitivity of phase-transition-based luminescent thermometers."}

Optical absorption, reduction and oxidation potentials and charge-transport properties are among the key considerations, and these are influenced both by molecular properties and the solid-state packing arrangement, making computational modelling challenging.

While sensitive to crystal symmetries and morphology, it is used ubiquitously to determine the growth modes of thin films. However, analysis of RHEED patterns depends on skilled experts and is therefore difficult to incorporate into the growth strategy in real-time. The development of machine learning (ML) processes, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), presents a unique opportunity towards real-time RHEED pattern recognition. In this study, we develop a CNN model that can accurately classify four common and distinct RHEED patterns present in chalcogenide thin film growth. Its reached accuracy reached 94.9% for single run and 91.2% when averaged over 20 seeds. Our network is able to distinguish the nucleation of three common growth modes encountered in epitaxy, namely Volmer Weber, Stransky-Krastanov and Frank-van der Merwe, potentially enabling future automation of substrate temperature and shutter control informed by RHEED data. The network is material-agnostic and distinguishes the VW process with greater than 98% accuracy but is somewhat more limited in its ability to properly classify roughening and the initiation of Stransky-Krastanov growth. Our findings show that ML techniques can be successfully implemented even in cases where there is no detailed knowledge of growth chemistry providing an avenue towards real-time incorporation of ML to control nanostructure nucleation and thin film morphology."}

Our analysis further reveals an intimate coupling between the local magnetic moments and charge quadrupoles, mediated by the strong spin-orbit interaction, that leads to the unusual canted configuration of magnetic moments observed in these systems. When structural degrees of freedom are included, the two materials exhibit pronounced differences. In Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ the strong coupling to Jahn-Teller distortions stabilizes the antiferroic $\\mathcal{Q}_{x^2-y^2}$ order, yielding excellent agreement with available experimental data. In contrast, the Jahn-Teller coupling is significantly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ and appears insufficient to stabilize the antiferroic quadrupolar order.

Our analysis thus successfully describes the mechanisms shaping the properties of the Re-compound while a full quantitative description of the magnetic ground state of Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ is still elusive."}

Phonon-assisted absorption and emission processes are explicitly included through the exciton-phonon coupling formalism. We find that phonon-mediated optical transitions provide a dominant contribution to both absorption and luminescence spectra, partially reconciling the discrepancy between the theoretical optical gap ($\\simeq$ 11 eV) and experimental emission around 6-7 eV.

The BTO membrane is grown epitaxially on a water-soluble Sr3Al2O6 sacrificial layer, released by selective dissolution, and transferred onto Si, yielding a strain-relaxed membrane with robust intrinsic polarization. Temperature dependent piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) reveals pronounced thermally driven evolution of domain orientation, consistent with reduced barriers for dipolar modulation in the freestanding state.

In quantum materials, these structural transformations often couple to electronic degrees of freedom, yet how the structural arrangements influence electronic phase transitions remains poorly understood. By analyzing hundreds of diffraction peaks from X-ray reciprocal space mapping, we determine the lattice basis vectors and mutual orientations of all coexisting phases in epitaxial V2O3 thin films after a symmetry-lowering transformation coincident with a metal-insulator transition. We identify the orientations of interfaces between all coexisting structures using the theory of martensitic phase transformations and find that the low temperature structure comprises finely tuned layered mixtures of alternating twin variants, akin to metal alloys. By comparing films grown on various substrate orientations, we show that the metal-insulator transition temperature increases monotonically with the degree to which these layered mixtures satisfy macroscopic strain compatibility imposed by the substrate."}

Here, we propose a method to realize finely tunable coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) for the NiTi alloy based upon a special combination of mechanical and thermal training. We achieve a near-zero in-plane CTE that is smaller in value than that of the FeNi-based Invar alloy. Atomistic simulations and theoretical calculations guide the method design and clarify the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between the processing conditions, the microstructural evolution, and the thermal expansion behavior.

Threading dislocations (TDs) can be electrochemically etched into transport pipelines that can carry the etchant through the NID layers to access the doped material. Experimentally this has been shown to involve a mechanism where the etching pathway may follow one TD into a doped layer and then propagate sideways through the doped layer to continue via a different TD. Across multiple layers this process creates complex pore structures that have been described as 'cascades'. Here, we build a stochastic simulation for the DBR etching process that can reproduce some key features of the observed microstructures including the cascade morphology. By comparing the simulation output to samples etched at a range of voltages, we show that we can reproduce variations in experimental chronoamperometry data with applied bias by varying the probability of etching the doped layers within the simulation. The outputs of the resulting simulations replicate the experimentally observed cascade morphology. At higher voltages, experimental data reveal a lower proportion of cascade features, a trend that is also replicated by the simulations for relevant probability values. Outputs of the simulations also correlate well with experimental chronoamperometry data for samples where - unlike in a DBR - the thicknesses of the doped layers vary through the epitaxial multilayer, suggesting that the probabilistic simulation can be applied to a range of structures to help understand the dislocation-mediated electrochemical etching process."}

In recent years, the use of high-performance computing clusters and massively parallel frameworks has enabled quantitative simulations of the evolution of individual and multiple precipitates at relevant length and time scales. However, predictive modeling of precipitate evolution remains challenging, in part because many key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the underlying physics are either unknown or have a high degree of uncertainty. In this work, we developed a workflow in which experimental data were used to parameterize a phase-field model to perform two-dimensional (2D) simulations of concurrent nucleation and evolution of $β_1$ precipitates in magnesium-neodymium alloy during aging. Matrix composition and precipitate number density at different aging times were obtained from atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy measurements, respectively. We applied a stereological method to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) number densities from experimental cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs. The estimated 3D number density data were then converted to effective 2D number densities. The effective 2D number density and composition data were used to determine the required model parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between simulation and experimental results. The parameterized model allows for quantitative phase-field simulations of nucleation and growth of $β_1$ precipitates, which can be employed to optimize aging time to achieve a target number density of precipitates. This work highlights an approach to overcome the challenges associated with parameterizing a coupled phase-field and nucleation model."}

It is demonstrated that polarization-sensitive photon echo spectroscopy in magnetic field provides a powerful method to access coherent exciton dynamics and reveal their energy level structure, which is hidden by inhomogeneous broadening. Exciton quantum beats observed in both Faraday and Voigt geometries offer a precise probe of the energy splittings among the four 1$s$ exciton states, enabling determination of the fine structure and bright-dark splittings. Application of this technique to bulk mixed halide perovskite crystals FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ reveals a bright-dark exciton splitting of $Δ_\\mathrm{X}=0.46~$meV, along with electron and hole Landé $g$ factors $g_\\mathrm{e}=3.38$ and $g_\\mathrm{h}=-1.14$, respectively.

Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation."}

Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25°C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel. This unexpected result can prompt new ideas for topology-based circuit elements with extremely low losses and power consumption."}
