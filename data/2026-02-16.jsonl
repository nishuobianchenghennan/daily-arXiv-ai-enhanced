Utilizing the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I within the alignment limit ($\\sin(β-α) \\approx 1$), we evaluate two primary benchmarks with degenerate scalar masses of 1000~GeV (BP1) and 2000~GeV (BP2).

These signatures, combined with hard transverse momentum distributions and central pseudorapidity ($|η| \\le 3$), allow for nearly absolute suppression of Standard Model backgrounds like $t\\bar{t}$, $W^+W^-Z$, and $ZZZ$. At an integrated luminosity of 10~ab$^{-1}$, we report a staggering statistical significance of 104,000 for the $H^+H^-$ channel and 3343 for the $HA$ channel in the BP1 scenario.

Standard Monte Carlo methods cannot capture rare yet critical default events, while existing rare-event simulation techniques fail to account for higher-order network effects and scale poorly with network size. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach -- Bi-Level Importance Sampling with Splitting -- and characterize individual bank defaults by decoupling them from the network's complex fixed-point dynamics. This separation enables a two-stage estimation process that directly generates samples from the banks' default events. We demonstrate theoretically that the method is both scalable and asymptotically optimal, and validate its effectiveness through numerical studies on empirically observed networks."}

Surprisingly, the lighter-mass HH subband exhibits a parabolic dispersion with Fermi wavevector below the anticrossing between the heavy-hole and light-hole subbands, while the heavier HH subband is non-parabolic throughout. Quantitative comparison with numerical calculations based on the Luttinger model reveals that both effective masses are enhanced by a common factor ($\\approx$ 2.3), which we attribute to many-body interactions. This common scaling factor has a very weak dependence on the 2DHG density, likely due to band hybridization. Our measured hole masses are compared with published cyclotron resonance and magnetotransport values.

The measured SC state properties, excepting only the fields detected below T$_c$, are representative of low T$_c$ singlet BCS SCs, not showing unusual coherence lengths or critical fields.

This overview provides a survey of the environment of the muon, from the normal state to the superfluid state, where the induced supercurrent and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov gap states provide coupling of the muon moment to the superfluid. The unusual topological superconductor LaNiGa$_2$, currently modeled as non-unitary triplet, is used as a case study.

These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport.

Our calculations encompass both Dirac-like and Majorana neutrinos and distinguish between two neutrino mass eigenstates. This work provides a valuable tool for future analyses, should a NSI signal be detected. Remarkably, our results show a smooth transition from the light to the heavy mediator approximation as the Universe cools down for non-resonant cases. Thus, for the widely studied heavy mediator, our new scheme eliminates the need to approximate at high redshifts when the temperature increases above the mediator mass, and it provides the tools to test the threshold of validity of the heavy mediator paradigm. While this work focuses on NSI mediated by a scalar particle, the presented framework could be adapted to a broader range of neutrino NSI and possibly to warm dark matter self-interacting scenarios."}

However, their applicability is fundamentally constrained by the limited time scales accessible to brute-force simulations. This bottleneck often stems from complex energy landscapes where the systems stay trapped in metastable states for long periods of time. Yet, the long-term evolution is controlled by the transitions between the metastable states, which are rare events and difficult to observe. We present an importance sampling method designed to accelerate the time scale of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. By employing a bias potential, our approach enhances the sampling of rare transition events while preserving the relative probabilities of distinct transition pathways. The bias potential is represented by a neural network which enables the flexibility needed for high-dimensional systems. We propose a rigorous formulation to obtain the original transition rates between metastable states using transition paths obtained from the biased simulation. We further use a branching random walk (BRW) technique to enhance efficiency and to reduce variance. The proposed methodology is validated on 2-dimensional and 14-dimensional systems, demonstrating its accuracy and scalability."}

Electrical resistance is completely eliminated below the critical temperature (Tc), which is the most important parameter in superconductivity. Since the discovery of copper oxide superconductors 39 years ago, many solid state chemists have made significant contributions to the field by discovering new compounds and producing high-quality samples for physical measurements. However, superconductivity research remains challenging for most solid state chemists because it requires knowledge of complicated solid state physics. This manuscript aims to provide a simple, intuitive introduction to superconductivity using only fundamental physics concepts that solid state chemists are familiar with. The author investigates a wide range of materials and classifies them according to the superconductivity mechanisms that may drive them. Specifically focusing on a series of copper oxide superconductors with the highest Tc at ambient conditions, the remarkable material dependence of Tc and the underlying, unconventional superconductivity mechanism that leads to the high Tc are thoroughly examined. Although our understanding of cuprate superconductivity is still fragmented, the author believes that once the branches and leaves are removed, the story will be fairly simple, similar to the phonon-based superconductivity mechanism revealed by the BCS theory. Furthermore, potential strategies for raising the Tc of cuprates and other superconductors are discussed. The author hopes that this article will pique interest in superconductors in young solid state chemists and encourage them to pursue the discovery of still unknown and unexplored room-temperature superconductors in the future."}

We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition."}

While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets.

Our current ED-MD simulations for nanotips show a non-monotonical variation of the time delay versus the electric field frequency for metal nanotips, and the presence of a critical rf electric field amplitude triggering the thermal runaway regardless of the field frequency. The calculated mass densities and kinematic viscosities of nanomelts for metal nanotips are found to be drastically different to those of bulk liquid metals at the melting point. Specifically, the viscosity of nanomelt under the rf electric field is revealed to be several orders of magnitude higher than the bulk liquid metal, resulting in substantial increase of spatial and temporal scales in the instability theory of electrocapillary wave within the viscosity-dominated regime, compared to the results of ED-MD simulations for Cu and Ti metals, while good agreement between the two methods on the critical wavelength and time delay of thermal runway is found for W nanotips."}

This review synthesizes the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these interaction-driven topological phases. Experimentally, the landscape has rapidly expanded from initial Chern insulators in trilayer systems to fully quantized QAH states in thicker systems. Theoretically, it is believed that moiré potential and electron-electron interaction cooperate and produce the QAH effect in such systems. Theoretical calculations also bring interesting questions, such as the formation of an interaction-driven topological phase known as an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). This review comprehensively covers the experimental hallmarks, the theoretical frameworks, including continuum models and many-body approaches, and the ensuing physical picture that reconciles the roles of interactions, displacement fields, and the moiré potentials. We conclude by outlining outstanding open questions and future directions, positioning RMG/hBN systems at the forefront of topological quantum matter."}

Rapid characterization of crystalline microstructure can accelerate the identification of these links and the development of materials with desired properties. Here, we combine a machine learning framework with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to enable fast inference of crystalline microstructure over large fields of view. The framework employs a transformer-based architecture to predict crystallographic orientations and phases from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, yielding spatially resolved maps of microstructural features at the nanoscale. With this framework, crystallographic orientations are inferred up to two orders of magnitude faster than widely used correlative template-matching approaches. This capability enables high-throughput characterization of complex crystalline materials and facilitates the establishment of structure-property relationships central to materials design and optimization."}

Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $ω^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect."}

Earthquakes occur when highly compressed fault surfaces accumulate large enough shear stresses, causing the faults to move relative to one another, or slip. The slip is accommodated within a thin layer of comminuted granular material -- called fault gouge -- between the fault surfaces. As a result, characterizing the mechanical behavior of fault gouge in response to shear is a major open problem in earthquake source physics. Modeling gouge is complicated by large deformations, inelasticity, rate dependence, and volumetric changes. As such, researchers typically rely on empirical formulations to capture the effective response. Here, we systematically develop a variational, finite-kinematics framework for fault gouge. We first describe a general theory for a rigid-viscoplastic, pressure-sensitive material, where the plasticity evolution follows from the principle of maximum dissipation. Then, we specialize the governing equations for a Cam-Clay material within a shearing and dilating layer. We rely on convexity considerations and experimental observations from consolidation tests of granular layers to calibrate the model and develop explicit solutions for the rate- and state- dependent response of the model to shear tests under constant compressive normal stress and prescribed shearing rate. To validate the model, we select common rate functions and compare numerical material point tests and theoretical solutions to standard laboratory experiments of shearing granular layers. Lastly, we discuss connections of the model to empirical rate-and-state friction laws."}

Recasting hadronization as a conditioned stochastic diffusion process provides a precise mathematical resolution to this tension. In particular, this language reveals explicitly that constraints stemming from conservation laws induce non-Markovian correlations between otherwise independent fragmentation steps, and that these correlations can be absorbed exactly into a renormalization of the local dynamics through a Doob $h$-transform. We develop this formalism for a $q\\bar{q}$ string in the chiral limit, where the longitudinal-transverse factorization of the Lund kernel becomes exact, enabling systematic power counting and clean ultraviolet (UV)/infrared (IR) separation. The dynamics organize naturally into a tower of effective theories distinguished by the remaining string mass, spanning a UV fixed point with scale-invariant transport coefficients, an intermediate regime where transverse phase space induces controlled running, and an IR boundary layer where non-local effects enter at leading order. The tower exhibits genuine Wilsonian structure, including $β$-functions, anomalous dimensions, and systematic matching conditions. The resulting framework achieves a clean factorization of universal microscopic fragmentation dynamics from infrared constraint effects, and opens new directions for both the theoretical analysis and practical simulation of hadronization."}

This document is the Accepted Manuscript of a published article in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, copyright \\c{opyright} American Chemical Society", "summary": "Assessing the time scale of biological processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sufficient statistical accuracy is a challenging task, as processes are often rare and/or slow events, which may extend largely beyond the time scale of what is accessible with modern day high performance computational infrastructure. Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value. In conclusion, our MSM framework equips REPPTIS simulations with a robust theoretical and practical foundation for extracting kinetic information from computationally efficient partial paths."}

However, the assignment of PL lines to particular defects has not been substantiated by modern theory. Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate from first principles which native defects introduce electronic states within the Cu$_2$O band gap, and therefore would produce lines in the PL spectrum.

The self-consistent electric field is also computed within the tensor formalism. The charge density is obtained by contracting over velocity degrees of freedom and extracting the zero Fourier mode, which provides the source term for a spectral Poisson solver.

In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of CO2 molecules on two-dimensional hexagonal transition-metal diboride monolayers, M2B2 (M = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Nb). The adsorption energies, structural distortions, and bonding characteristics are systematically analyzed to understand how the metal center governs CO2 activation. The calculated adsorption energies range from -1.84 to -2.16 eV (or -1.98 to -4.42 eV), with Ti2B2 and Sc2B2 exhibiting the strongest CO2 binding, while Y2B2, Zr2B2, and Nb2B2 show moderately strong chemisorption. Adsorption induces significant molecular activation, evidenced by elongated C-O bonds (1.27-1.29 Angstrom) and bent O-C-O angles (129-132 degrees), compared to the linear gas-phase configuration (1.17 Angstrom, 180 degrees). Charge analysis further reveals substantial electron transfer from the monolayer to CO2, consistent with strong chemisorption and structural deformation. Correspondingly, the shift toward less negative IpCOHP(Ef) values indicates a pronounced weakening of the internal C-O bonds, reflecting increased population of antibonding pi* orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the activated CO2 species is thermally sensitive: while most M2B2 surfaces retain stable adsorption at 300 K, Ti2B2 drives spontaneous CO2 dissociation into CO and O, revealing a temperature-assisted activation pathway. These findings highlight how the choice of transition metal tunes electronic interactions, adsorption energetics, and activation pathways on M2B2 surfaces.

When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap. The KMS-based analytic formalism thus provides a comprehensive physical understanding of magnetoplasmons in multilayer structures."}

Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering. The quasiparticle dispersion mismatch creates recovery bottlenecks that control non-equilibrium lifetimes.

While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets.

Here, we explored the complex interplay between surface texture morphology, layer composition, wetting, and optical properties of Cu, Ag, and CuAg thin films deposited on textured silicon substrates via magnetron sputtering. Employing data mining and machine learning techniques, we identified robust correlations between contact angle and surface fractal dimension across all layer types promoting Cassie-Baxter surface state formation. Our analysis revealed a significant connection between layer thickness and surface topography entropy deficit, suggesting a dynamic evolution of surface order/disorder during metal film growth. Furthermore, we observed that contact angle sensitivity to layer thickness implied a correlation with microstructure evolution. Through K-Means clustering, we successfully categorized the formed surface textures morphology. Finally, a Random Forest regression model was developed to accurately predict water contact angles (Mean Absolute Error around 5 deg) using only texture and optical parameters. The model, along with accompanying Python code, is publicly available. Our findings establish a pathway towards targeted surface texture morphology engineering for tailored material performance."}

Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics."}

Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $ω^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect."}

We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size."}

The results differ, ranging from GaSe 2D film growth at tilted 2D planes to observed spiral structures, thereby calling for a deeper understanding of the impact of the substrate interface on the growth of GaSe films. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive reexamination of the growth mechanism of GaSe on GaAs substrates with (211)B and (001)B orientations, investigating the nature of the 2D/3D interface and the resulting morphology of the 2D GaSe films. We do this by investigating different methods of preparation of the GaAs substrate surface before the growth of GaSe by MBE, the importance of which has not been considered before. Our results resolve the mechanistic origin of tilted versus non-tilted 2D growth and establish a general interface-driven orientation selection rule linking substrate symmetry and dangling-bond coordination to layered heteroepitaxy. This framework provides a scalable interface-engineering pathway for deterministic control of layered chalcogenide heterostructures and enables wafer-scale integration with established semiconductor device platforms."}

We establish that, in general, the ALP-meson and meson-ALP overlaps are different due to the presence of ALP-quark derivative couplings in the UV Lagrangian, and need to be treated separately. Using lattice results and BaBar, Belle, and NA48/2 data, we obtain exclusion limits on the overlaps and give projections for Belle II. Our techniques are independent of the branching ratios of the ALP, hence, robust against ALP decay channel assumptions. For masses of the ALP below 1 GeV, the bounds on the effective scale of the ALP physics extend to $\\mathcal{O}$(TeV) for restricted regions of the parameter space for the ALP-$π$ and $π$-ALP overlaps.

The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$) hosts edge-states that have zero group velocity at $k_x=π$ and are therefore `non-chiral'. The edge states undergo a bifurcation transition at an exceptional point(EP)in the BZ and delocalise into the bulk. As the non-reciprocity is increased, the bulk states that are approaching each other are converted into pairs of EPs due to non-Hermiticity. As the non-reciprocity is further increased, there is a `Russian doll'-like nested proliferation of pairs of EPs, leading to an EP-cascade. The proliferation of EPs takes place only at specific values of the non-hermiticity parameter, leading to a step-like structure in the EP-pair density when plotted as a function of non-Hermiticity. Further, using wave packet dynamics, we find a tunable regime where the non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilised for large timescales. The `self-acceleration' term in the equations of motion tends to diffuse the wave packets into the bulk, thus making them `ephemeral edge states'. But we find that for small non-hermiticity, the edge localisation is stabilised until late times for sufficiently wider wave packets. Thus, we have brought forth an intriguing phenomenology of the exceptional phase of the non-reciprocal Haldane model, which may bear direct relevance for systems such as disordered Kitaev honeycomb model, wherein such ERs have been predicted."}

Additionally, current machine learning-based inference methods are typically limited to estimating scalar parameters in a multidimensional space rather than full differential distributions. We propose a general framework for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate Distributions of Interest (DoI), defined as learnable invertible transformations of the feature space. We introduce Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, preserving tractability without combinatorial explosion. Crucially, we develop an amortized training strategy that learns the conditional dependence of the DoI on nuisance parameters in a single optimization process, bypassing the need for repetitive training during the likelihood scan. This allows for the simultaneous extraction of the underlying distribution and the robust profiling of nuisances. The method is validated on a synthetic dataset emulating a high-energy physics measurement with multiple systematic sources, demonstrating its potential for unbinned, functional measurements in complex analyses."}

This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems."}

However, the assignment of PL lines to particular defects has not been substantiated by modern theory. Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate from first principles which native defects introduce electronic states within the Cu$_2$O band gap, and therefore would produce lines in the PL spectrum.

Here, we present a many-body extension of the three-step photoemission model for semiconducting photocathodes, directly integrating the $GW$ approximation and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of density functional theory (DFT). This approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of standard DFT by explicitly accounting for quasiparticle and excitonic effects in the photoexcitation process. The quantum efficiency (QE) is evaluated by combining the ab initio absorption with an emission probability derived as an exciton-weighted average. We validate this model on representative alkali antimonides and demonstrate that a qualitative many-body description successfully captures complex spectral features that empirical models fail to reproduce. Furthermore, by incorporating macroscopic optical effects such as thin-film interference and polarization via Fresnel post-processing, we achieve quantitative agreement with experimental QE values without any adjustment. Minor discrepancies near the photoemission threshold are attributed to the idealized surface barrier adopted in the model and impurity effects in the samples, highlighting specific directions for future refinements. This work establishes a robust, parameter-free ab initio tool that bridges microscopic electronic correlation with macroscopic observables, providing a critical pathway for the rational design of next-generation electron sources."}

Although physics-informed glass-structure descriptors have demonstrated strong structure-reactivity relationships for predominantly amorphous systems, their extension to heterogeneous precursors with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases has been limited. Here, quantitative X-ray diffraction combined with bulk compositional analysis was used to reconstruct the effective amorphous compositions of five fly ashes (FAs) and three ground granulated blast-furnace slags (GGBSs). These compositions served as inputs for molecular dynamics simulations employing a melt-and-quench approach to generate atomic-scale structural models of the glassy phases. Based on these structures, the previously introduced descriptors, i.e., average metal oxygen dissociation energy and average metal oxygen bond strength, were refined to cover a broader compositional space spanning SiO2-Al2O3-TiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-MgO-MnO-Na2O-K2O. The refined descriptors exhibit strong inverse correlations with multiple independent reactivity indicators, including cumulative heat release from isothermal calorimetry, bound water content from thermogravimetric analysis, and compressive strength, for both single precursors and binary FA-GGBS blends activated with NaOH. These results demonstrate that physics-informed glass-structure descriptors can be extended from ideal amorphous systems to heterogeneous mixed-phase precursors and capture relative intrinsic reactivity trends in alkaline solutions. The proposed framework provides a transferable, structure-informed basis for comparative assessment of precursor reactivity that complements experimental testing and may inform precursor screening and mix designs for AAM and blended cement systems."}

In order to unveil the Mn dissolution mechanism in MnO$_{2}$ cathode cells under RAZIB operation conditions, the energetic feasibility for Mn vacancy formation was probed in both charged (MnO$_{2}$) and discharged (ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$) phases of $α$ and $λ$ polymorphs of MnO$_{2}$ using density functional theory. The formation of a Mn vacancy, and consequently the dissolution of Mn as Mn$^{2+}_{(aq)}$, was found to be thermodynamically feasible for the $α$-ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ phase due to the energetically unfavourable Zn bent coordination formed during the Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation process, indicating that Mn dissolution is promoted by an unstable Zn coordination environment. The theoretical calculations were then corroborated by operando $^{1}$H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments which captured the Mn dissolution occurring throughout the RAZIB discharge, with subsequent electrochemical deposition of the Mn atoms on the electrode during charge. The combined computational and experimental analysis reveals the critical role of defect energetics and coordination environment in driving active material dissolution, and consequently capacity fade, with the proposed mechanism also relevant for understanding cathode degradation in other intercalating ion battery chemistries."}

A longstanding challenge has been assembling diamond-like superstructures for photonic devices. Traditionally, such open superstructures require functionalized nanoparticles with directional or anisotropic interactions, reminiscent of valence bonding in a diamond. Here, we present a robust strategy for assembling valence-free nanoparticles into a broad array of cubic superstructures. By grafting nanoparticles with oppositely charged, end-functionalized water-soluble polymers of adjustable molecular weight, we gain control over electrostatic interactions and conformational constraints. This unified approach yields lattices analogous to rock salt, CsCl, zinc-blende, diamond, and the rare simple cubic phase, with tunable lattice constants. Theoretical models and simulations elucidate the underlying interactions, providing a framework for engineering valence-free nanoparticle superlattices."}

We report the transformation of diamond embedded ceramic matrix composites during hypersonic impact. Diamond particles embedded in cubic boron nitride matrix provide a superhard composite that was subjected to high impact collisions of metal projectiles travelling at speeds reaching Mach 8.45. Our observations suggest that the energy absorption and fracture of the composite is primarily enabled via the phase change of diamond into graphite. Characterization of the impact-fractured composite shows transformed diamond particles and provides details of the shock-induced phase transformation and the nature of diamond-graphite interfaces formed during rapid phase change. The study provides new understanding of phase transformation of diamond under extreme conditions."}

In this work, we propose an approach to predict spinodal behavior by introducing a disorder viscosity correction to bulk free energies computed from finite, small, representative cells. We approximate the energy penalty required to transition into a disordered state to enable the stabilization of locally concave bulk free energy regions - essential for interface formation - while suppressing long-range concentration fluctuations. This approximation circumvents the complexity of full ab initio parameterization of interfacial properties and is well-suited for high-throughput and machine-learning frameworks. Our approach captures the necessary physics underpinning spinodal kinetics, offering a scalable route to predict spinodal regions in compositionally complex and high-entropy materials."}

Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics."}

It has been observed that the CNP switches sign below a certain GNR width, and in this article, we explore this via computational modelling of the electric field and the conductance of GNRs in the presence of an AFM tip. We show that CNP is expected to shift towards lower values as GNR width reduces as a result of the significantly enhanced electric field around edges, but that a change in sign is not expected. We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size."}
