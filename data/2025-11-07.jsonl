Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group\nanalysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave\ncorrelations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal\nthat the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it\namplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes\nimpurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for\ndisorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of\ntransverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing\npositive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations\nand contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of\nspin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the\ninterplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels."}
