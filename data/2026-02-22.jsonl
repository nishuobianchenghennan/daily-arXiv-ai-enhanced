We show that an effective spin polarization tensor leading to a correct description of the longitudinal spin polarization of $Λ$ hyperons simultaneously yields a positive alignment of vector mesons ($φ$ and $K^{*0}$) that grows monotonically with transverse momentum and centrality. Similar trends can be seen in the data, suggesting a possible common mechanism for longitudinal spin polarization and alignment. However, model calculations are insufficient to explain the data in a fully quantitative way. The correlation found between the magnitude of the $Λ$ longitudinal polarization and vector meson alignment suggests further more elaborate investigations of this issue."}

The novel approach PDF2ISR is employed to study the transverse-momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs in the small-$p_T(\\ell\\ell)$ region. This framework is particularly well suited for such investigations, as it provides a systematic treatment of the dominant non-perturbative effects and their interplay. In order to extract robust physical conclusions, a detailed analysis of the technical aspects involved in the simulation of the intrinsic transverse momenta of partons inside the proton, as well as the remnant recoil schemes, was carried out. Furthermore, different approaches for the treatment of the strong coupling at low scales were investigated and confronted with available experimental data. This comparison enabled an assessment of the sensitivity of the experimental measurements to the chosen low-scale behaviour of $α_s$."}

Perez"], "title": "Stochastic galactic supernova flux of semi-relativistic particles", "comment": "19 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "New exotic particles with MeV masses, such as axion-like particles or light dark matter, can be emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with semi-relativistic velocities. Due to their speed dispersion, they would arrive at Earth as an extended packet with a time spread that can be as large as tens of millennia for typical detectors. It has been argued in the literature that the superposition of packets from all galactic SNe would give rise to a smooth and stationary diffuse flux that could be observable on terrestrial experiments. In this article, we critically examine this hypothesis by carrying out a numerical simulation of the galactic history of SN explosions. We show that, although the particle packets do overlap, due to the short observational time window, each of them only contributes with a very narrow range of energies and with an intensity that depends on the SN distance. As a consequence, the energy dependence of the resulting flux is extremely sensitive to the stochastic nature of the SN population and far from smooth. This has profound implications for the expected signature in terrestrial experiments, which displays a spectral shape that is not properly described by the smooth approximation. We develop a numerical tool to compute this stochastic galactic flux for generic semi-relativistic particles, which also allows us to explore sub-MeV particles, where the smooth diffuse flux approach does not hold. To test this framework, we revisit existing bounds on axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter, finding weaker constraints than previously reported."}

We highlight a number of incorrect assumptions in earlier calculations that relied on the effective-potential approach. In contrast with the earlier findings, we show that the one-loop corrections can have an effect of ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ on the predictions for the BSM-Higgs masses, and they can also induce non-negligible mixing between the SM-like and BSM states in the neutral-scalar sector."}
