### [1] [Nucleation suppression by charge screening on grain boundaries: a kinetic model for bulk imprint in polycrystalline ferroelectric thin films](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13748)
*Huanhuan Tian,Jianguo Yang,Ming Liu*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于晶界的体积印记新机制来解释铁电存储器中的印记效应，补充了传统上只关注界面效应的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铁电存储器中的“印记效应”是一个严重的可靠性问题。传统模型主要归因于界面电荷屏蔽，但忽略了晶界的重要作用。

Method: 研究人员建立了一个相场模型，通过模拟晶界附近的畴核如何受电荷屏蔽调控来解释印记过程。

Result: 模型结果表明，通过调控晶界附近的畴核，可以稳定地解释印记过程，并且该结果与关键的实验趋势一致。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解印记过程提供了新的见解，指出体积效应（特别是晶界）的重要性，有助于提升铁电存储器件的可靠性。

Abstract: The imprint effect, a significant reliability challenge in ferroelectric memories, manifests as a shift in the coercive field during retention and endurance tests, ultimately degrading the usable memory window. \rv{While traditional models attribute imprint primarily to charge screening at the interface between the dead layer and the ferroelectric film, the contribution from grain boundaries has been largely overlooked. This work advances a bulk imprint mechanism by establishing a phase-field model, which demonstrates that the tuning of domain nuclei near grain boundaries via charge screening consistently explains the imprint process and aligns with key experimental trends.} These findings provide novel insights into the imprint process and advance the understanding of reliability issues in ferroelectric memory devices.

TL;DR: 该研究通过理论计算发现，二维材料 CrTe2 及其缺陷或掺杂形式，在检测CO、NO等有害气体方面比 CrSe2 更灵敏，是一种极具潜力的气体传感材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳米传感器在环境监测、工业安全和公共健康领域中，对于痕量检测CO、NO、SO2等有害气体至关重要。因此，寻找和开发新型、高效的二维传感材料是该领域的一个重要研究方向。

Method: 该研究采用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算方法，通过分析 CrSe2 和 CrTe2 单层材料吸附有害气体（CO, NO, SO2, CH4）时的结构和电子性质（如吸附能、态密度、电荷转移、功函数等），来评估其气敏性能。研究还进一步探讨了引入空位缺陷和进行元素掺杂（Ge, Sb, Sn）对传感机制的影响。

Result: 计算结果表明，具有Te空位的CrTe2（VTe-CrTe2）对CO、NO和SO2表现出最强的吸附能力。与CrSe2相比，CrTe2（尤其是在缺陷和掺杂状态下）在气体吸附后表现出更显著的电荷转移、电子态密度和功函数变化，显示出更高的传感灵敏度。

Conclusion: 相比于 CrSe2，CrTe2 单层材料，特别是经过缺陷工程或掺杂改性后，因其对有害气体更强的电子响应和更高的灵敏度，被证实是一种更优越的气体传感材料。

Abstract: Nanosensors are critical in environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and public health by detecting specific hazardous gases like CO, NO, SO_2, and CH_4 at trace levels. This study uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the gas-sensing capabilities of chromium diselenide (CrSe_2) and chromium ditelluride (CrTe_2) monolayers through their structural and electronic responses to gas adsorption. Adsorption energy analysis shows that Te vacancy-induced CrTe_2 (VTe-CrTe_2) exhibits the strongest binding with energies of -1.52, -1.79, and -1.61 eV for CO, NO, and SO_2, respectively. Similarly, CrSe_2 has its values of -1.13, -1.17, -0.90, and -1.12 eV for CO, NO, SO_2, and CH_2, respectively, indicating suitability for reversible sensing. This study also investigates how substitutional doping of Ge, Sb, and Sn influences the sensing mechanism of CrSe_2 and CrTe_2 monolayers. Density of states (DOS) analysis highlights notable electronic changes around the Fermi level, especially in VTe-CrTe_2 and Sb/Sn-doped CrTe_2, confirming their enhanced sensing abilities. Charge density difference analysis shows significant charge redistribution, with CrTe_2 experiencing stronger charge transfer effects than CrSe_2. Variations in electrostatic potential and work function further demonstrate the higher sensitivity of CrTe_2, particularly in its defective and doped forms, confirming its status as a superior material for gas sensing applications.

Abstract: Recently, nanocrystals in the regime of vanishing quantum confinement-termed bulk nanocrystals (BNCs)-have demonstrated remarkable optical gain characteristics. While their high-power lasing performance was demonstrated convincingly, the photophysics at low and intermediate powers-where charge-carrier populations are discrete-remain unexplored. Using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array technology, we resolve the dynamics and energetics of six multi-carrier excited states in individual CdSe/CdS core/shell BNCs, containing up to four electrons and two holes. Each state exhibits bimodal emission, indicative of thermal equilibrium between closely spaced electron and hole levels, confirmed via temperature-dependent single-particle measurements. Quantification of radiative and nonradiative decay channels reveals strongly suppressed Auger recombination through both the negative- and positive-trion pathways. We present a model that combines statistical scaling of rate constants with Fermi-Dirac thermal occupations of electron and hole levels, bridging the transitional regime between quantum-confined and bulk nanocrystals, and providing a comprehensive framework for understanding this emerging class of materials.

Abstract: Multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in its excited state is studied by first-principles calculations based on density function theory (DFT). The activation pathways of the JT distortions are analyzed to elucidate and quantify the contribution of different vibrational modes. The results show that the dominant vibrational modes in the JT distortions are closely related to the phonon sideband observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), consistent with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation results. Our calculations provide a new way to understand the origin and the mechanism of the vibronic coupling of the system. The obtained dominant vibrational modes coupled to the NV centre and their interactions with electronic states provides new insights into dephasing, relaxation and optically driven quantum effects, and are critical for the application to quantum information, magnetometry and sensing.

Abstract: Automation and high-throughput characterization and synthesis for material development are becoming increasingly common; these approaches require machine learning (ML) tools to assess material properties, ideally based on a single measurement. Here, ML models are developed to predict magnetization from X-ray diffraction (XRD) for iron oxide nanoparticles. Our approach is to first develop a set of simulated data that links modulated XRD, based on a crystallographic information file (CIF), to a simple magnetic model to determine magnetization at a given magnetic field, thereby enabling us to train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regression models on a large amount of simulated data. The models are validated by synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles and measuring their crystal structure via XRD and room-temperature magnetization curves. In doing so, we can fine-tune both the training hyperparameters and the optimal size of the simulated datasets used to train the models. Through this optimization, the best models can achieve an $R^2$ greater than 0.9 for five experimental samples, used for tuning, for predicting the max magnetization (at 2.8 T) of the measurement. Lastly, we demonstrate reasonable predictions on the full magnetization vs. magnetic field curve, showing that the RF model excels at predicting the high magnetic field values, which is key for determining the success of an iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis for applications like magnetic particle imaging (MPI), thermal magnetic particle imaging (T-MPI), and hyperthermia.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present molecular dynamics simulations of the adsorption of mixed CO2-water vapors on a graphene flakes substrate, a model inspired by the microporous structure of activated carbons. Adsorption strength is quantified through a reduced energy measure that avoids ambiguities associated with defining adsorption regions. We find that CO2 adsorbs more strongly and more rapidly than water across all temperatures studied. Adsorption from wet vapors was observed to result in higher CO2 uptake compared with dry vapors at temperatures below 375 K. At intermediate temperatures, water molecules were seen to form clusters that interact with both the substrate and CO2, potentially promoting CO2 adsorption. Additionally, we observe that the GF substrate inhibits the formation of large water clusters, altering water aggregation dynamics near the surface. These findings highlight a cooperative adsorption mechanism in humid environments and suggest that graphene-flakes-based materials may perform effectively for carbon capture under realistic, moisture-containing conditions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific exploration, but most methods automate procedural tasks without engaging in scientific reasoning, limiting autonomy in discovery. We introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework where large language models autonomously design, execute, and interpret atomistic simulations. In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M-N-C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias. Altogether, multi-agent collaboration accelerates materials discovery and marks a new paradigm for autonomous scientific exploration.

Abstract: To optimize the processing conditions for the (Cr,Fe)S non-equilibrium phase with a pyrrhotite-type structure, the phase states and magnetic properties of the specimens obtained at various sintering temperatures were investigated. A slightly off-stoichiometric composition of Cr23Fe23S54 (approximately (Cr,Fe)7S8) sintered and quenched from 1323 K indicates a single-phase pyrrhotite-type structure with a layered-NiAs-type structure in which vacancies occupy every two layers (C12/c1; the space number is 15). The compound shows fully compensated ferrimagnetic behavior at a magnetization compensated temperature of approximately 200 K. The magnetic behavior exhibits a typical N-type ferrimagnet, as predicted by Néel. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, it is found that the compound is composed of Fe2+ and Cr3+. The large magnetic coercivity of 38 kOe at 5 K is also unique and can be applied to spintronic devices. Furthermore, changing the quenching temperature enables control of the degree of order of the vacancies in the interlayer and results in tuning of the magnetization compensated temperature. First-principles calculations show a pseudo-gap located at the Fermi level in the up-spin band, suggesting high spin polarization as well as the NiAs-type structure indicated in the previous our report.

Abstract: Transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is a material characterization technique based on laser-induced thermoelastic excitation of thermal and acoustic gratings. On opaque samples, these gratings are dynamic surface displacements that reflect the sample's elastic and thermal properties, enabling both types of parameters to be determined from a single experiment. Here, we develop a detailed finite element model (FEM) simulation of the TGS experiment that fully captures the coupling between the thermal and mechanical fields, as well as the optical detection of surface displacement using a heterodyning approach. Using custom-designed two-dimensional elements, the model is particularly suitable for analyzing TGS measurements on anisotropic media, for which analytical theory is insufficient. The simulation captures not only the anisotropic relaxation of the thermoelastic field but also several acoustic features that arise at very short (ultra-transient) timescales and provide additional information about the elastic properties of the examined material. The model offers new opportunities for the in silico testing of various modifications of TGS experiments and their applications to a broad class of materials.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries dominate battery research and industry due to their long research history and high energy density. However, increasing demand and limited lithium resources have raised lithium prices and battery costs, motivating interest in alternative chemistries. Potassium-ion batteries have recently attracted attention because potassium is more abundant and potentially lower cost, although the technology remains at an early stage and requires further insight for development. In this work, recently developed methods for rigorous analysis of electrode rate performance are applied to published rate-performance data from a wide range of potassium-ion batteries. Using specific capacity (mAh per g) versus charge and discharge rate curves, performance parameters are extracted to evaluate the applicability of the key model underlying these methods and to analyze opportunities for potassium-ion batteries. Relationships between these parameters and electrode properties are used to interpret performance trends and compare potassium-ion batteries with established technologies. The analysis shows that the model effectively fits potassium-ion battery rate-performance data and allows reliable extraction of performance parameters. While potassium-ion batteries generally exhibit lower specific capacities than lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, their upper limit of rate performance is found to exceed that of lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and related two-dimensional material electrodes, despite the larger atomic size and mass of potassium.

Abstract: Dirac fermions, characterized by their linear dispersion and relativistic nature, have emerged as a prominent class of quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. While the Dirac equation, initially developed in the context of high-energy physics, provides a remarkable framework for describing the electronic properties of these materials, the inherent symmetry constraints of condensed matter often lead to deviations from the idealized paradigm. In particular, three-dimensional Dirac fermions in solids often exhibit anisotropic behavior, challenging the notion of perfect symmetry inherent in the Dirac equation. Here, we report the observation of isotropic massive Dirac fermions in LaAlSi through Landau level spectroscopy. The presence of three-dimensional massive Dirac fermions across the Fermi energy is demonstrated by quantized and semiclassical analyses of the magnetic field evolution of Landau level transitions. The isotropic topological nature, Fermi velocity, and Dirac mass are evidenced by the identical magneto-infrared response among the Faraday and three Voigt geometries. Furthermore, we observe an unusually large oscillator strength in the zeroth Landau level transition of the Dirac fermion, compared to transitions with higher indices. This phenomenon, supported by model calculations, can be attributed to the combined effects of the partial excitation of Dirac fermion and the resonant dielectric coupling with the Weyl plasma. Our work provides a strategy for realizing ideal quasiparticle excitations and their coupling effects in condensed matter systems, offering a platform for exploring relativistic physics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，利用电化学阻抗谱（EIS）的实验数据来估算光电化学电池中析氧反应（OER）的速率常数，以替代传统的第一性原理计算。

Motivation: 水电解的效率主要受限于半导体光阳极上缓慢的析氧反应（OER）。为了找出其中的限速步骤，需要确定其反应速率常数。传统方法依赖理论计算，而本研究旨在开发一种直接从实验数据中估算这些常数的方法，从而更直接地研究反应动力学。

Abstract: The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics is reshaping our understanding of quantum systems by revealing states and phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. While non-Hermiticity is typically associated with gain-loss processes in open systems, we uncover a fundamentally different route to non-Hermitian behavior emerging from non-equilibrium correlations. In photoexcited semiconductors, the effective interaction between electrons and holes gives rise to a pseudo-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Hamiltonian (PH-BSH) that governs excitonic states in the presence of excited populations. Within this framework, we identify a previously unknown class of excitonic quasiparticles - exceptional excitons - corresponding to exceptional points embedded inside the electron-hole continuum. Exceptional excitons emerge at the onset of population inversion, and represent the strongly renormalized counterparts of the system's equilibrium excitons. They are spatially localized, protected against hybridization with the continuum, and remain long-lived even in regimes where conventional excitons undergo a Mott transition. Crucially, exceptional excitons appear only when the PH-BSH is evaluated with non-thermal, resonantly generated carrier populations that support an excitonic superfluid. Ab initio results for monolayer WS_2 explicitly demonstrate this scenario and show that exceptional excitons can be realized with existing ultrafast pumping techniques. We also identify distinctive optical and photoemission signatures that enable their unambiguous detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在密度泛函微扰理论（DFPT）框架下将温度视为微扰的新方法，用于计算金属的电子热力学性质，并分析了其在低温下的行为，特别是在存在范霍夫奇点的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固体的许多性质与温度的相关性主要由晶格振动决定，但金属在低温下会表现出纯粹的电子效应（如线性比热）。本文旨在发展一种将温度作为微扰引入密度泛函微扰理论（DFPT）的方法，从而更精确地描述这些电子热力学性质。

Method: 作者将温度视为一种微扰，在密度泛函微扰理论（DFPT）的框架下进行处理。通过引入一个包含阿德勒-维泽（Adler-Wiser）算符的电子介电算符，该方法可以自洽地计算由温度引起的电荷密度响应。对于低温极限（T→0）情况，作者使用索末菲展开来处理计算中的发散问题。

Result: 该方法成功计算了金属铝的自由能二阶导数和熵的一阶导数。研究发现，只要费米能级不处于范霍夫奇点上，电子自由能就与温度的平方（T²）成正比。研究还分析了当费米能级处于不同类型范霍夫奇点时，体系可能表现出的不同温度行为。

Conclusion: 该理论框架适用于一维、二维或三维周期性体系，为在密度泛函理论（DFT）和密度泛函微扰理论（DFPT）中研究与温度相关的电子不稳定性（如电荷密度波）提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The temperature dependence of most solid-state properties is dominated by lattice vibrations, but metals display notable purely electronic effects at low temperature, such as the linear specific heat and the linear entropy, that were derived by Sommerfeld for the non-interacting electron gas via the low-temperature expansion of Fermi-Dirac integrals. Here we treat temperature as a perturbation within density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). For finite temperature, we show how self-consistency screens the bare, temperature-induced density change obtained in the non-interacting picture: the inverse transpose of the electronic dielectric operator, that includes Adler-Wiser and a term related to the shift in Fermi level, links the self-consistent density response to the bare thermal density change. This approach is implemented in DFTK, and demonstrated by the computation of the second-order derivative of the free energy, and the first-order derivative of entropy for aluminum. Then, we examine the $T\!\to\!0$ limit. The finite temperature formalism contains divergences, that we cure using the Sommerfeld expansion to analyze metallic systems at 0 K. The electronic free energy is quadratic in $T$ provided the Fermi level is not at a Van Hove singularity of the density of states. If the latter happens, another temperature behavior might appear, depending on the type of Van Hove singularity, that we analyze. Our formulation applies to systems periodic in one, two, or three dimensions, and provides a basis for studying temperature-dependent electronic instabilities (e.g., charge-density waves) within density-functional theory and DFPT.

TL;DR: 本文研究了电子束在拓扑节环半金属中反射时发生的异常空间位移，并发现这种位移可以用来探测节环的几何形状和拓扑性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子束在界面散射时会经历一种反常的空间位移。作者旨在探究这种现象在受镜面对称保护的节环半金属中的表现，并希望利用这种位移来揭示材料的拓扑能带结构特性。

Method: 该研究理论上分析了电子束从节环半金属反射时的反常空间位移。他们通过计算界面动量平面中位移矢量的分布，并对其矢量场在半圆形路径上的环流（κ_s）进行积分，从而将其与节环的整数拓扑荷（χ_h）联系起来。

Result: 研究发现，节环的存在会增强这种空间位移。位移矢量的分布轮廓可以揭示节环的几何形状。更重要的是，位移的环流量化了节环的拓扑信息，其关系为 κ_s = -2πχ_h。这种位移及其环流还能反映材料拓扑相变的特征。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了拓扑节环的一种新的物理特征，并证明了反常散射位移是一种探测拓扑能带结构的强大工具。

Abstract: An electron beam may experience an anomalous spatial shift during an interface scattering process. Here, we investigate this phenomenon for reflection from mirror-symmetry-protected nodal-ring semimetals, which are characterized by an integer topological charge $χ_h$. We show that the shift is generally enhanced by the presence of nodal rings, and the ring's geometry can be inferred from the profile of shift vectors in the interface momentum plane. Importantly, the anomalous shift encodes the topological information of the ring, where the circulation of the shift vector field $κ_s$ over a semicircle is governed by the topological charge, with a simple relationship: $κ_s=-2πχ_h$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shift and its circulation reflect distinct features of topological phase transitions of the charged rings. This study uncovers a novel physical signature of topological nodal rings and positions anomalous scattering shifts as a powerful tool for probing topological band structures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的DFT+U方法，可以准确、快速且无需经验参数地预测光伏材料（CZTS和CZGS）的电子性质，其预测的能带隙精度优于传统的高精度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的光伏材料电子性质预测方法难以同时满足三个要求：1. 能带隙结果可靠；2. 无需经验性调整参数；3. 计算开销低。该研究旨在找到一种满足所有这些需求的计算方案。

Method: 作者使用了DFT+U方法，其核心创新在于：1. 通过线性响应理论（linear response）来计算校正参数U值，避免了经验性调整。2. 将U值修正应用到所有构成导带和价带边缘的原子轨道上，而不仅限于传统的3d/4f轨道。

Result: 该方法预测的能带隙非常准确，甚至略优于计算成本高昂的GW方法。研究还发现，常规的DFT+U+J方法会显著恶化结果，但一种改进的平坦面（flat-plane）DFT+U+J方法可以获得与DFT+U方法一致的良好结果。

Conclusion: 对于铜锌锡硫（CZTS）和铜锌锗硫（CZGS）这类光伏材料，本文所用的DFT+U方法，是一种能够兼顾准确性、低计算成本且无需经验参数的理想电子性质预测工具。

Abstract: Streamlined prediction of the electronic properties of photoactive materials warrants a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based approach that (i) yields reliable bandgaps, (ii) is free of empirically tuned parameters, and (iii) exhibits low computational overhead. Here we show that for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnGeS4 kesterite photovoltaic materials, all three of these demands are met by the DFT plus Hubbard U technique (DFT+U) with corrective parameters evaluated via minimum-tracking linear response. The predicted bandgaps are found to even marginally outperform those from the self-consistent GW approach. Key to this method's success is the application of Hubbard U corrections to all atomic subspaces that dominate the conduction and valence band edges, as opposed to the conventional approach of correcting 3d and 4f atomic states. Intriguingly, the inclusion of Hund's J corrections via the extended DFT+U+J functional significantly worsens these results. This under performance can be ameliorated through the use of the Burgess-Linscott-O'Regan (BLOR) flat-plane based Hubbard U plus Hund's J functional, with bandgap predictions in close agreement with the conventional DFT+U method. The DFT+U method is also used to predict defect-induced changes to the bandgap and associated formation energies, in 1,728-atom supercells.

Motivation: 旨在揭示反钙钛矿材料 Mn$_3$GeN 中以前未被认识的精细磁性和结构行为，并理解其结构扭曲、磁序和电子结构之间的相互作用。

Abstract: The crystal and magnetic structures of the nitride antiperovskite Mn$_3$GeN reveals ferrimagnetic order stemming from a distorted kagome-derived lattice of the Mn atoms. Polycrystalline Mn$_3$GeN was synthesized via a solid-state reaction and characterized using neutron powder diffraction, DC magnetometry, and first-principles calculations. Rietveld refinement reveals near-stoichiometric composition (Mn$_3$GeN$_{0.94(1)}$) adopting a tetragonal $I4/mcm$ structure at $T$ = 500 K and below, featuring axially distorted and tilted [NMn$_6$] octahedra that result in a buckled Mn kagome lattice. On heating, the tetragonal distortion and octahedral tilt angle decrease continuously before transitioning to the cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ antiperovskite phase at $T \approx$ 524 K. Neutron diffraction and magnetometry together reveal noncollinear ferrimagnetic ordering. For 30 K $\le T \le$ 500 K, the magnetic structure is described by a single propagation vector, $k$ = (0, 0, 0), with inequivalent Mn1 and Mn2 sublattices that couple antiferromagnetically to yield a net moment. Density functional theory-based calculations show the different local moments originate from the bandwidths associated with the distinct Mn-N bond lengths. The temperature dependence of the sublattice moments indicates a compensation-like crossover between Mn1- and Mn2-derived magnetization near 380 K. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized subtlety in the magnetic and structural behavior of Mn$_3$GeN, highlighting the interplay between structural distortions, magnetic ordering, and electronic structure in kagome-derived antiperovskite materials.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate effects of boron substitution on the structural and electronic properties of small tungsten clusters using density functional theory (DFT). We construct a series of tungsten boride clusters by replacing tungsten atoms with boron atoms to analyze their stability and other properties. Boron substitution in Wn clusters results in significant geometric distortions shortening the bond lengths and thereby reducing the clusters overall symmetry. The boron atoms prefers to occupy apex or edge positions. Its lower atomic radius and stronger electronegativity are the driving forces behind these structural changes.The binding energy per atom, HOMO LUMO gap, and chemical hardness increase with boron incorporation, indicating enhanced electronic stability.Additionally, negative chemical potentials are observed, which confirm greater charge localization and lower reactivity.BB stretches at high frequencies suggest strong boron-boron bonds with localized electrons, consistent with negative chemical potentials that promote charge retention over delocalization. WB modes in mid frequencies reflect metal boron interactions stabilizing the cluster, reducing overall reactivity as seen in prior Fukui analyses of electron density.Fukui functions pinpoint nucleophilic or electrophilic sites on W-B clusters, corroborating low reactivity from localized charges negative potentials confirm electrons are tightly bound, limiting site accessibility for reactions.

Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a novel class of collinear antiferromagnetism exhibiting non-relativistic spin splitting without net magnetization, driven by lattice symmetry rather than spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we introduce a coordination-driven chemical strategy to realize altermagnetic (AM) spin splitting in two-dimensional (2D) planar tetracoordinated Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that replacing centrosymmetric pyrazine (pyz) ligands with non-centrosymmetric imidazole (imz) linkers in Cr-based MOFs reduces lattice symmetry, enabling g-wave AM spin splitting up to 65 meV. Furthermore, frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) allows selective ligand spin polarization, inducing a shift to d-wave AM anisotropy in polycyclic ligand-based 2D MOFs with spin splitting up to 83.9 meV. Microscopic magnetic exchange interactions (J) analysis reveals that ligand-mediated interactions dominate over metal-metal coupling, stabilizing AM order in systems with radical ligands. Interestingly, we further confirm AM spin splitting in spin wave spectrum, where chiral magnon splitting is observed. Finally, we show that AM spin splitting gives rise to experimentally accessible charge to spin conversion, emerging as a linear response in d-wave and as a symmetry-allowed nonlinear effect in g-wave 2D AM MOFs. This work establishes coordination chemistry as a powerful and versatile route to symmetry control in 2D MOFs, enabling rational design of 2D molecular materials with tunable electronic and AM properties for next-generation spintronic devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对快速斜坡压缩下材料的X射线衍射（XRD）研究仅限于确定样品相态和晶胞参数，本研究旨在扩展此分析方法，以获取更多关于微观结构（如晶粒尺寸和晶格应变）的信息。

Method: 研究人员将威廉姆森-霍尔分析法应用于在快速斜坡压缩条件下的铅（Pb）和金（Au）的X射线衍射数据，这两种金属在实验压力下都从面心立方（fcc）晶格转变为体心立方（bcc）晶格。

Result: 分析显示，快速斜坡压缩下的铅（Pb）具有纳米晶结构，晶粒尺寸为(4 ± 1) nm，晶格应变为0.006 ± 0.002；而金（Au）的平均晶粒尺寸大于12 nm，并表现出对于纯金属元素而言前所未有的高晶格应变，为0.014 ± 0.001。

Conclusion: 该分析表明，威廉姆森-霍尔方法适用于快速斜坡压缩下的材料研究，它揭示了bcc-Pb的超细晶粒结构是其极端硬化的原因，并发现了金（Au）中前所未有的高晶格应变。此方法为理解极端条件下的材料行为提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Phase transitions in materials under fast ramp compression are an ongoing research topic, which is part of several global projects like inertial fusion. Currently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination of samples under fast ramp compression is limited to the determination of the sample phase state and the unit cell lattice parameters. Here, we propose to extend this examination route by introducing the Williamson-Hall analysis of the XRD data measured in samples under fast ramp rate conditions. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we performed an analysis for ramp compressed lead $(P = 200 GPa)$ and gold $(P = 1003 GPa)$, which both exhibit a transition from the face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice to the body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice at the studied pressures. The analysis showed that lead under fast ramp compression has a nanocrystalline structure with a crystalline size of $D = (4 \pm 1) nm$ and lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.006 \pm 0.002 $. The effect of extreme hardening of bcc-Pb under fast ramp compression can be explained as the formation of an ultrafine grain structure in this metal. Elemental gold exhibits average crystalline size $D > 12 nm $ and unprecedentedly high, for a pure metallic element, lattice strain $\varepsilon = 0.014 \pm 0.001 $ under fast ramp compression.

Motivation: 理解并揭示最近在扭曲的钛酸钡（BaTiO₃）双层结构中观察到的复杂剪切应变形态和极性莫尔拓扑图案的起源。

Method: 采用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，并结合一种创新的分析方法，将力分解为声学和光学部分的贡献。

Result: 计算结果表明，主要作用于声学相关运动的力产生了剪切应变的驻波。这些声学波导致剪切应变自发组织并形成梯度。最终，剪切应变梯度与电偶极子的耦合是产生由涡旋和反涡旋组成的极性莫尔偶极子图案的主要原因。与光学声子相关的力也起作用，但程度较小。

Conclusion: 该研究明确了扭曲 BaTiO₃ 双层结构中复杂剪切应变和极性拓扑图案的形成机制。核心结论是，声学相关的运动是产生剪切应变波的主要驱动力，而该应变的梯度与电偶极子之间的耦合效应是形成极性莫尔涡旋阵列的关键。

Abstract: Density functional theory calculations are conducted to understand and reveal the origin of the complex shear strain morphology and of the polar Moiré topological pattern recently observed in twisted BaTiO$_3$ bilayers. Our first-principles calculations, along with an original analysis of them allowing the decomposition of forces into the acoustic and optical contributions, point out to the occurrence of forces mostly acting on the {\it acoustic-related} motions to produce the standing waves of the shear strain. Such acoustic waves naturally generate a striking self-organization of the shear strains, and hence create a peculiar gradient of these shear strains. A Moiré dipole pattern, consisting of the interpenetrated arrays of vortices and antivortices made of the electric dipoles, then mostly arises due to the coupling of this gradient of the shear strain with the electric dipoles. Furthermore, other forces, namely acting on the motions associated with the {\it optical phonons}, could also play a role in the formation of these polar vortices and antivortices, but at a smaller extent.

Abstract: The thermal transport community is increasingly interested in rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) of their measurements. In this work, we argue that Bayesian parameter estimation (BPE) represents a powerful framework for both analysis/fitting and UQ. We provide a detailed walkthrough of the technique (including code to duplicate our results) and example analysis based on measuring the thermal conductance of a gold/sapphire interface with FDTR. Comparisons are made against traditional analysis/UQ techniques adopted by the thermal transport community. Notable advantages of BPE include the interpretability of its results, including the capacity to indicate incorrect input assumptions, as well as a way to balance overall goodness of fit against prior knowledge of feasible parameter values. In some cases, incorporating this additional information can affect not only the magnitude of error bars but the inferred values themselves.

Motivation: 传统的蒙特卡洛方法在处理光学厚度大的介质时，计算成本会线性增加，导致效率低下。为了解决这个问题并利用现代AI硬件的优势，研究者寻求新的加速算法。

Method: 研究人员提出了生成式蒙特卡洛（GMC）方法。该方法将单元传输问题重构为条件生成任务，使用条件流匹配（conditional flow matching）训练神经网络来直接采样粒子离开单元时的状态（位置、方向、路径长度），从而避免了模拟详细的散射过程。同时，通过光学坐标缩放，实现了单一模型在不同材料间的通用性。

Result: GMC方法在保持与标准蒙特卡洛方法相同的统计保真度和收敛率的同时，显著提升了计算效率。特别是在光学厚度大的区域，GMC的单次传输计算成本为常数O(1)，相比传统方法的线性增长，实现了数量级的加速。该方法在两个典型基准测试中得到了验证。

Conclusion: GMC框架将粒子输运模拟与为神经网络推理而优化的现代计算架构相结合，为输运代码利用未来AI硬件和算法的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present Generative Monte Carlo (GMC), a novel paradigm for particle transport simulation that integrates generative artificial intelligence directly into the stochastic solution of the linear Boltzmann equation. By reformulating the cell-transmission problem as a conditional generation task, we train neural networks using conditional flow matching to sample particle exit states, including position, direction, and path length, without simulating scattering histories. The method employs optical coordinate scaling, enabling a single trained model to generalize across any material. We validate GMC on two canonical benchmarks, namely a heterogeneous lattice problem characteristic of nuclear reactor cores and a linearized hohlraum geometry representative of high-energy density radiative transfer. Results demonstrate that GMC preserves the statistical fidelity of standard Monte Carlo, exhibiting the expected $1/\sqrt{N}$ convergence rate while maintaining accurate scalar flux profiles. While standard Monte Carlo computational cost scales linearly with optical thickness in the diffusive limit, GMC achieves constant $O(1)$ cost per cell transmission, yielding order-of-magnitude speedups in optically thick regimes. This framework strategically aligns particle transport with modern computing architectures optimized for neural network inference, positioning transport codes to leverage ongoing advances in AI hardware and algorithms.

Abstract: The Stefan problem is a classical free-boundary problem that models phase-change processes and poses computational challenges due to its moving interface and nonlinear temperature-phase coupling. In this work, we develop a physics-informed neural network framework for solving two-phase Stefan problems. The proposed method explicitly tracks the interface motion and enforces the discontinuity in the temperature gradient across the interface while maintaining global consistency of the temperature field. Our approach employs two neural networks: one representing the moving interface and the other for the temperature field. The interface network allows rapid categorization of thermal diffusivity in the spatial domain, which is a crucial step for selecting training points for the temperature network. The temperature network's input is augmented with a modified zero-level set function to accurately capture the jump in its normal derivative across the interface. Numerical experiments on two-phase dynamical Stefan problems demonstrate the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the ones obtained by other neural network methodology in literature. The results indicate that the proposed framework offers a robust and flexible alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving phase-change problems governed by moving boundaries. In addition, the proposed method can capture an unstable interface evolution associated with the Mullins-Sekerka instability.

Abstract: Dynamical control of quantum matter is a challenging, yet promising direction for probing strongly correlated states. Motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$ that demonstrated optical control of magnetization, we propose a protocol for probing magnetization dynamics in flat-band ferromagnets. We investigate the nucleation and dynamical growth of magnetic bubbles prepared on top of a false vaccum in both itinerant ferromagnets and spin-polarized Chern insulators. For ferromagnetic metals, we emphasize the crucial role of a non-trivial quantum geometry in the magnetization dynamics, which in turn also provides a probe for the quantum metric. Furthermore, for quantum Hall ferromagnets, we show how properties of chiral edge modes localized at domain-wall boundaries can be dynamically accessed. Our work demonstrates the potential for nonequilibrium protocols to control and probe strongly correlated phases, with particular relevance for twisted MoTe$_2$ and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.

Motivation: 在双层镍氧化物La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$中发现高温超导后，学术界需要一个无需外部压力的理论模型来统一解释其超导相和自旋密度波（SDW）相。

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ necessitates a minimal theoretical model that unifies the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase without external pressure or strain. We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

### [28] [Correlation functions at the topological quantum phase transition in the S=1 XXZ chain with single-ion anisotropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14075)
*Toshiya Hikihara,Akira Furusaki*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了一维 S=1 XXZ 自旋模型在相变点上的量子临界行为，结合理论（玻色化）与数值方法（DMRG）分析了其奇特的关联函数，并探讨了键交替扰动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已知在一维 S=1 XXZ 自旋模型中的 Haldane 相与 large-D 相之间的相变点上，系统表现出由 c=1 共形场论描述的量子临界性。然而，该临界点上关联函数的具体行为（“奇特行为”）尚不明确，本文旨在深入探究并阐明这一点。

Method: 论文主要采用了两种方法：
1.  **理论分析**: 使用玻色化（bosonization）方法研究各种关联函数并推导其渐近形式。
2.  **数值验证**: 利用密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）方法对理论预测进行验证。
此外，还讨论了弱键交替（weak bond alternation）对临界基态的影响。

Result: 研究发现并澄清了关联函数的渐近形式：纵向自旋关联函数仅在均匀部分（uniform sector）呈现幂律衰减，而横向关联函数仅在交错部分（staggered sector）呈现幂律衰减。这些理论预测得到了 DMRG 数值计算的证实。此外，研究还表明，引入弱键交替可以在关联函数中诱导出原本缺失的幂律衰减部分。

Conclusion: 本文成功地结合玻色化理论和 DMRG 数值计算，阐明了一维 S=1 XXZ 模型在 Haldane/large-D 相变点上的特殊量子临界行为。研究不仅解释了关联函数中依赖于扇区（均匀/交错）的幂律衰减特性，还揭示了键交替扰动如何恢复关联函数中缺失的幂律部分，为理解该模型的临界现象提供了清晰的物理图像。

Abstract: We study the one-dimensional S=1 XXZ spin model with single-ion anisotropy. It is known that at the transition points between the Haldane and large-D phases, the model exhibits a quantum criticality described by the Gaussian theory, i.e., a conformal field theory with the central charge c=1. Using the bosonization approach, we investigate various correlation functions at the phase transition and derive their asymptotic forms. This allows us to clarify their peculiar behavior: the longitudinal (transverse) two-point spin correlation function has components that decay algebraically only in the uniform (staggered) sector. These theoretical predictions are verified by the numerical calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group method. The effect of weak bond alternation on the critical ground state at the phase transition is also discussed. It is shown that the bond alternation induces the missing power-law components in the correlation functions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用正弦平方形变（SSD）精确确定一维系统量子临界点的新方法。该方法通过寻找局部物理量在何处变得均匀来确定相变边界，并在伊辛模型上验证了其准确性，同时证明了其在里德堡原子实验中是可行的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确地确定一维量子系统的量子相变边界是一个重要问题。本文旨在提出一种更高效、更精确的方法，尤其适用于中小规模的系统，以克服现有方法可能存在的对系统尺寸或计算资源的较大依赖。

Method: 该研究提出一种基于正弦平方形变（SSD）的方法。其核心思想是：当一维无能隙系统经过SSD处理后，其基态的任何局域可观测量在热力学极限下都具有平移对称性。因此，通过使用密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）计算SSD哈密顿量的基态，并结合有限尺寸标度分析，找到局域可观测量（如横向磁化强度）变得与位置无关的点，该点即为量子临界点。

Result: 1. 对于最近邻伊辛模型，该方法能用小至84个格点的系统精确估算出临界点，与文献结果一致。 2. 对于长程相互作用模型，反铁磁相区相比最近邻情况有所缩小。 3. 提出了在里德堡原子阵列中实现该方法的实验方案。 4. 该方法能提供多个独立的标度条件，有助于精确确定临界点和临界指数。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于正弦平方形变（SSD）的方法，是确定一维系统量子临界点的一种精确且高效的工具，即便是小尺寸系统也能获得高精度结果。该方法不仅在理论模型上得到验证，还具备实验可行性，为研究量子临界现象提供了新的有力途径。

Abstract: We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that ``if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.

Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the ruby lattice with uniform first- and second-neighbor interactions, which forms a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra. Using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), we study the ground state of the system to find that it assumes a gapped threefold-degenerate simplex crystal ground state, with strong singlets formed on pairs of neighboring triangles. We argue that the formation of the simplex singlet ground state at the isotropic point relates to the weak inter-triangle coupling limit where an effective spin-chirality Hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice exhibits an extensively degenerate ground state manifold of singlet coverings at the mean-field level. Under an applied Zeeman field, the iPEPS simulations uncover magnetization plateaus at $m/m_s = 0, 1/3, 1/2,$ and $2/3$, separated by intermediate supersolid phases, all breaking the sixfold rotational symmetry of the lattice. Unlike the checkerboard lattice, these plateaus cannot be described by strongly localized magnons.

Abstract: Soft phonon modes in tetragonal CeCoSi, which undergoes a structural transition at $T_0=12$ K followed by antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\text{N}}=9.5$ K, have been investigated using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. Pronounced softening was detected in the transverse acoustic modes corresponding to the $(yz+zx)$-type monoclinic distortion, consistent with the experimentally determined triclinic structure. Remarkably, the softening persists up to the zone boundary along (0, 0, $q$), indicating a short correlation length of the lattice instability. This instability, characterized by a Curie-type strain susceptibility, is interpreted as a consequence of the on-site $4f$-$5d$ hybridization, which is intrinsic to this crystal structure due to the lack of inversion symmetry at the two Ce sites.

Abstract: Analysis of the thermal and baric evolution of resistance in $LaBa_2Fe_3O_{8+δ}$ enabled the construction of its pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram, which prominently displays a critical boundary, $P^{MIT}_c(T)$, marking the transition from localized to hole-type extended states. The relatively low critical pressures [$P^{MIT}_c(T) \approx 3$-8 GPa] suggest that, as $P \rightarrow P_c$ in this narrow-gap, strongly correlated charge-transfer system, both the hybridization strength and the charge-transfer character are progressively enhanced - ultimately leading to the emergence of metallicity. Emphasizing the electronic nature of this transition, pressure-dependent structural analyses at room temperature reveal no associated structural phase transition at $P^{MIT}_c(T)$; the system retains a (weakly tetragonally distorted) quasicubic perovskite structure with Murnaghan-type compressibility up to 30\,GPa. The emergence of hole delocalization and metallic conduction, coupled with suppressed antiferromagnetism, suggests proximity to quantum criticality.

Abstract: We analyze the impact of the lattice geometry on the thermodynamic transition to magnetically ordered phases in strongly interacting electron systems for various Bravais lattices in three and four dimensions, including both local and nonlocal correlation effects. In a first step we use the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which takes into account purely local correlations, to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities of the Hubbard model on three (3d-sc) and four dimensional (4d-sc) simple cubic/hypercubic, as well as on three dimensional body- (bcc) and face-centered (fcc) cubic lattices, and determine the transition temperature to the corresponding magnetically-ordered state. In a second step, we exploit the dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), a diagrammatic extension of DMFT, to include the effect of nonlocal correlations which are particularly important in the vicinity of the corresponding phase transition. For the bipartite 3d-sc, 4d-sc and bcc lattices nonlocal fluctuations lead to a substantial reduction of the DMFT transition temperature consistent to the overall tendency of mean-field approaches to overestimate the stability of ordered phases. As expected, the magnitude of the difference between the DMFT, being exact in the limit of large connectivity/dimensions, and D$Γ$A transition temperatures decreases with increasing coordination number. On a more practical perspective, these results also provide a reasonable guidance to evaluate the expected overestimation of the DMFT ordering temperature for different material geometries. For the fcc lattice, on the other hand, the ordered phase observed in DMFT vanishes completely within D$Γ$A which is consistent with the existence of strong geometric frustration in this lattice.

Conclusion: 这项工作为二维量子系统的大规模张量网络计算提供了一条有前景且高效的路径。

Abstract: We propose a single-layer tensor network framework for the variational determination of ground states in two-dimensional quantum lattice models. By combining the nested tensor network method [Phys. Rev. B 96, 045128 (2017)] with the automatic differentiation technique, our approach can reduce the computational cost by three orders of magnitude in bond dimension, and therefore enables highly efficient variational ground-state calculations. We demonstrate the capability of this framework through two quantum spin models: the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model. Even without GPU acceleration or symmetry implimention, we have achieved the bond dimension of 9 and obtained accurate ground-state energy and consistent order parameters compared to prior studies. In particular, we confirm the existence of an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid ground state in the Shastry-Sutherland model. We have further discussed the convergence of the algorithm and its potential improvements. Our work provides a promising route for large-scale tensor network calculations of two-dimensional quantum systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文展示了在特定条件下，二维双层半导体中的层间激子可以实现真正的玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚（Bose-Einstein Condensation），这挑战了默明-瓦格纳定理的普遍观点。

Motivation: 默明-瓦格纳定理通常认为，在非零温度下，二维玻色子系统不可能存在长程有序。本研究旨在挑战这一普遍观点，并探索在二维系统中实现玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚的可能性。

Method: 论文提出了一种理论模型，指出实现层间激子玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚需要满足三个关键条件：（1）施加电场以减小层间带隙，使激子自发出现；（2）利用能够实现长程电子-空穴交换相互作用的能带结构；（3）施加有限的磁场。

Result: 研究结果表明，在上述条件下，双层半导体中可以出现真正的层间激子玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚。一个重要的发现是，超流性和铁电有序可以在这种二维激子绝缘体中同时存在。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，与对默明-瓦格纳定理的普遍理解相反，在二维双层半导体中实现真正的长程有序（即激子玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚）是可能的。这为在二维材料中观察到超流性和铁电有序共存的现象提供了理论依据。

Abstract: It is generally argued that Mermin-Wagner theorem excludes the possibility of long-range order in two dimensional bosonic systems at non-zero temperatures. In contrast, we show here that generic bilayer semiconductors could demonstrate true Bose-Einstein condensation of interlayer excitons. We show that the key requirements include (i) reduction of the interlayer band gap using an applied electric field so that excitons spontaneously appear in the ground state, (ii) band structure that allows for long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, and (iii) a finite magnetic field. Our results indicate that superfluidity and ferroelectric order can co-exist in two dimensional excitonic insulators.

Motivation: 铁电半导体α-GeTe(111)的占据电子态已被广泛研究，但其未占据态，特别是靠近导带底的能带结构，很大程度上仍是未知的。

Method: 使用时间和角度分辨光电子能谱（tr-ARPES）实验，并结合布洛赫谱函数计算进行分析。

Result: 在α-GeTe(111)中意外地观察到三个镜像势态（IPS），它们延伸至真空能级以上0.8 eV。研究解析了前三个IPS的完整抛物线色散关系并确定了它们的束缚能。

Conclusion: 这种镜像势态在真空能级以上的意外持续存在，源于GeTe中强的偶极跃迁和大量电子“储存库”的存在。

Abstract: The ferroelectric semiconductor α-GeTe(111) has attracted significant attention in the last decade due to its unique properties, with extensive studies focusing on its occupied electronic bandstructure. In contrast, its unoccupied states - particularly those near the conduction band minimum - remain largely unexplored. In an effort to characterize those states, we surprisingly observe three image potential states (IPS) in α-GeTe(111) extending up to 0.8 eV above the vacuum level. Using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we resolve the full parabolic dispersions of the first three IPS and determine their binding energies. Our analysis, combined with Bloch spectral function calculations, reveals that the unexpected persistence of IPS above the vacuum level originates from strong dipole transitions and the presence of large electron reservoirs in GeTe.

Conclusion: 研究结果有力地证明了Sn/Si(111)单层是实现手性拓扑超导的杰出候选材料。

Abstract: A third monolayer of tin atoms on the semiconductor substrate Si(111) has been shown to become superconducting upon six to ten percent hole doping. Experiments have reported promising results hinting at a superconducting chiral $d$-wave order parameter. Here we examine Sn/Si(111) by combining most recent ab initio results, quasi-particle interference calculations, state-of-the-art truncated-unity functional renormalization group simulations and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis. We show remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical quasi-particle interference data both in the metallic and superconducting regimes. The interacting phase diagram reveals that the superconductivity is indeed chiral $d$-wave with Chern number $C=4$. Surprisingly, magnetically ordered phases are absent, instead we find charge density wave order, as observed in related compounds, as a competing phase. Our results demonstrate that Sn/Si(111) is an outstanding candidate material for chiral topological superconductivity.

TL;DR: 通过在旋转磁场下测量二碲化铀（UTe$_2$）的热导率，研究人员发现其能隙中存在沿$b$轴的节点，从而确定了其一个超导相的对称性属于$B_{2u}$表示。

Motivation: 在研究非传统超导时，一个反复出现的障碍是有效并确定性地识别新材料中超导序参量的对称性。二碲化铀（UTe$_2$）表现出前所未有的多种超导相，但没有一个相的对称性得到最终确认。

Method: 研究人员在低温低磁场条件下，测量了UTe$_2$的热导率。他们重点研究了当外加磁场在$b$-$c$平面内旋转时，热导率随磁场角度的变化情况，并利用实验确定的费米面，对所有可能的能隙结构进行了建模比较。

Result: 实验观察到热导率随磁场角度呈现出清晰且显著的振荡，这表明超导能隙中存在点节点。通过建模分析，研究人员确定了这些节点位于晶体学的$b$轴方向。

Abstract: One of the recurring hurdles in studying unconventional superconductivity is the challenge of efficiently and conclusively identifying the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in a new material. Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.

Motivation: 在像Sr₂RuO₄这样的d电子超导体中，由于μSR奈特位移本身很小，精确测量其变化以确定配对对称性一直是一个挑战。以往的测量方法可能受到实验设置的干扰。

Method: 研究人员采用μSR技术，通过使用单晶样品以避免多晶体间的杂散磁场干扰，对Sr₂RuO₄进行了高精度的奈特位移(Knight shift)测量，并结合了在同一晶体上测得的体磁化率数据进行分析。

Result: 实验发现，在超导转变温度以下，自旋奈特位移有显著下降。研究还指出了在μSR实验中使用多晶体样品会导致由杂散磁场引起的顺磁性位移伪影。正常态下的μSR奈特位移被确定为-116±7 ppm。

Conclusion: 该结果与Sr₂RuO₄中的自旋单重态配对模型一致。本研究为理解Sr₂RuO₄的超导机理提供了关键证据，并凸显了μSR技术作为探测超导体中自旋磁化率的有力工具的潜力。

Abstract: Muon spin rotation ($μ$SR) measurements of internal magnetic field shifts, known as the muon Knight shift, is used for determining pairing symmetries in superconductors. While this technique has been especially effective for $f$-electron-based heavy-fermion superconductors, it remains challenging in $d$-electron-based superconductors such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where the Knight shift is intrinsically small. Here, we report high-precision muon Knight shift measurements of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We observe that using multiple pieces of crystals, a common practice in $μ$SR measurements, induces a substantial paramagnetic shift below the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, when a weak magnetic field is applied. We attribute such an unresolved paramagnetic shift to stray fields generated by neighboring diamagnetic crystals. To avoid this, one piece of crystal was used in this study. We experimentally determine the muon Knight shift of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the normal state to be -116$\pm$7 ppm. By combining the observed muon Knight shift with independently determined bulk magnetization data from the same crystal used in $μ$SR and carefully separating various contributions to the shift, we confirm a significant reduction in the spin Knight shift below $T_c$, consistent with spin-singlet-like pairing. This result constitutes the precise muon Knight shift measurement in a $d$-electron-based superconductor. Our results highlight the potential of $μ$SR as a powerful complementary technique to the established method of nuclear magnetic resonance for probing the spin susceptibility in superconductors.

Abstract: We study anisotropic superconductivity in the nearly quarter-filled $α$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice. We analyze an extended Hubbard model with off-site attractive interactions within the mean-field framework and find two distinct chiral $d+id'$-wave superconducting phases characterized by different Chern numbers. We further investigate the superconducting mechanism mediated by spin fluctuations arising from purely repulsive interactions by applying the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation to the Hubbard model. The gap symmetry obtained by solving the linearized Eliashberg equation is $d$-wave, which corresponds to a $d+id'$-wave superconducting state with a Chern number of $8$, including the spin degree of freedom. The $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation, which possesses the largest spectral weight at finite energies arising from the incipient flat band, gives rise to an effective spin-singlet pairing glue between rim sites.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in both bulk and thin-film bilayer nickelates has garnered significant attention. In this study, inspired by recent STM experiments on thin films, we investigate the quasiparticle interference (QPI) characteristics of bilayer nickelates in both normal and superconducting states to identify their Fermiology and pairing symmetry. We demonstrate that the mirror symmetry inherent in the bilayer structure induces mirror-selective quasiparticle scattering by establishing selection rules based on the mirror properties of impurities and the mirror eigenvalues of electronic wavefunctions. This mirror-selective scattering allows for the differentiation of distinct Fermiologies, as QPI patterns vary markedly between scenarios with and without the $d_{z^2}$-bonding Fermi surface (FS). Furthermore, it enables the separate detection of sign changes in superconducting gaps both within the same FS and between different FSs. Crucially, if the mirror-symmetry-enforced selection rules are ignored, the QPI response of an $s_\pm$-wave state can masquerade as that of a conventional $s$-wave state, leading to a misidentification of the pairing symmetry. When combined with field-dependent and reference QPI measurements, this approach facilitates the precise determination of pairing symmetry, even in the presence of FS-dependent gaps and gap anisotropy. Additionally, we discuss practical considerations for STM measurements to effectively identify the pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that mirror-selective QPI is a powerful tool for distinguishing between different Fermiologies and pairing states, which is helpful in pinning down pairing symmetry and revealing the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前主流的范德华异质结制备方法（手动堆叠）在规模化、界面质量和厚度控制上存在巨大挑战，阻碍了其在自旋电子学中的应用。因此，需要开发一种可扩展的、能制备高质量异质结的新方法。

3. 这些现象证明，高质量的外延界面增强了材料间的邻近效应，从而对整体的磁性和输运性质产生了显著影响。

Conclusion: 这项研究深入揭示了FGT/WSe2范德华异质结的磁性和输运特性，为探索新兴的二维物理现象和推进下一代二维自旋电子技术的发展，建立了一个可扩展的研究平台。

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures combining two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer highly promising opportunities for tailoring 2D magnetism through interfacial proximity effects, enabling unique physical phenomena inaccessible in 3D systems and achieving functionalities beyond conventional spintronics. However, current fabrication of vdW heterostructures still relies heavily on the manual stacking of exfoliated 2D flakes, leading to critical challenges in scalability, interfacial quality, thickness control and device integration. This work reports on the realization of all-epitaxial, high-quality Fe5-xGeTe2(FGT)/WSe2 heterostructures exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and room-temperature ferromagnetism. The FGT/WSe2 system demonstrates temperature-driven magnetic transitions, higher-order PMA contributions and large anisotropic magnetoresistance, highlighting sublattice-specific contributions to magnetic and transport properties. Notably, the FGT/WSe2 heterostructures display unconventional physical phenomena, including thickness- and temperature-dependent sign reversal of exchange bias, a reversed thickness trend in the unconventional Hall effect, and a non-monotonic PMA-thickness dependence. These anomalies indicate pronounced interfacial contributions arising from proximity effects enhanced by epitaxial interface quality. Collectively, this study provides deep insights into the magnetic and transport properties of FGT/WSe2 vdW heterostructures, establishing a scalable platform for exploring emergent 2D physics and advancing next-generation 2D spintronic technologies.

### [43] [Thermal response functions and second sound in graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13988)
*Antonio Martinez Margolles,Patrick K. Schelling*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 本文通过分子动力学（MD）模拟研究了石墨烯中的“第二声”（热波）现象。研究发现，在室温下可以观察到第二声，其衰减主要是由材料声子能带结构自身的性质决定，而非仅仅是传统理论（BTE）所描述的声子散射。该模拟结果与传统理论的预测存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电子器件的尺寸与工作时间尺度不断缩减，经典的傅里叶散热定律在微观尺度开始失效。因此，理解包括第二声在内的弹道热输运现象，对于解决前沿电子器件的散热问题至关重要。

Method: 研究人员开发了一种基于热响应函数的分子动力学（MD）模拟方法，并将其应用于独立的石墨烯。同时，他们将模拟结果与基于线性化玻尔兹曼输运方程（BTE）的计算结果进行了对比分析。

Result: MD模拟预测，在300K的室温下，石墨烯中存在强烈的第二声信号。研究发现，第二声的衰减时间主要由声子能带结构导致的“退相干”决定，并对热激发的长度尺度敏感。与MD模拟结果相比，BTE方法预测的第二声寿命要长得多。

Conclusion: 第二声的耗散主要由声子能带结构产生的退相干效应决定，而非传统玻尔兹曼输运方程（BTE）理论所强调的电阻性非谐声子散射。这表明，在描述微观尺度的热现象时，该研究的分子动力学模拟方法能提供更符合实际的预测。

Abstract: The propagation of second sound, and more broadly the ballistic transport of heat, is of central importance in heat dissipation from electronic devices at very short length and time scales. Specifically, there is an interest in the practical implications of violations of Fourier's law. Recently, we have developed a simulation approach based on thermal-response functions that is appropriate for elucidating physics beyond the diffusive regime, including time-dependent sources and second-sound propagation. The methods are applied to free-standing graphene simulated using molecular-dynamics (MD) with empirical potentials. The simulations predict a strong second-sound signal at T=300K for length scales of at least L=68.1nm. It is demonstrated that the second-sound dissipation time is determined primarily by decoherence that emerges from the details of the phonon band structure. It is also shown that the decay time for second sound depends sensitively on the length scale that characterizes the thermal excitation. This is in contrast with theories based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), where second-sound dissipation is determined primarily by the resistive anharmonic phonon scattering rate. Calculations using the linearized BTE are also presented, along with analysis of second sound based on the BTE. This approach results in significantly longer lifetimes for second sound in comparison to our MD simulation results. Predictions for the response due to time-dependent sources are also presented, including insight into how time-dependent sources could be tuned to result in weak or strong temperature oscillations, and how time-dependent experiments might probe the spectra associated with second sound. Results are discussed in the context of second sound in graphite in the temperature range from 100-200K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自旋螺旋作为一种基础的非共线磁结构，能够产生多种反映自旋手性的新奇现象。因此，研究人员希望探究由这种特定磁结构（公度自旋螺旋）引发的新物理效应。

Method: 研究人员通过理论分析，研究了含有公度自旋螺旋的金属体系。他们分析了自旋螺旋如何在电子结构中引入奇宇称的自旋分裂和自旋节点线。接着，在考虑自旋轨道耦合和磁化强度的情况下，他们发现这些节点线会打开能隙，从而产生和集中贝里曲率，最终导致反常霍尔效应。

Result: 主要结果是发现了一种由螺旋磁性诱导的非传统反常霍尔效应。具体来说，自旋螺旋结构导致了电子能带中出现自旋节点线，而在自旋轨道耦合和磁化作用下，这些节点线会打开能隙，并在能隙附近集中贝里曲率，从而产生了独特的反常霍尔效应信号。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，自旋轨道耦合、螺旋平面方向和磁化方向三者之间的相互作用是产生这种螺旋诱导反常霍尔效应的关键。该效应具有普适性，预计将在许多具有公度自旋螺旋的材料中出现。

Abstract: Spin spirals represent a fundamental class of noncollinear yet coplanar magnetic structures that give rise to diverse emergent phenomena reflecting spin chirality. We investigate metallic systems hosting commensurate spin spirals and uncover an unconventional anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by spiral magnetism. The spin spiral introduces odd-parity spin splitting with polarization perpendicular to the helical plane, forming spin-nodal lines in the electronic structure. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, we find that these nodal lines become gapped by finite magnetization, concentrating the Berry curvature near the gap and generating a distinctive AHE. We identify the interplay among the spin-orbit coupling, helical plane orientation, and magnetization direction as the key ingredient for this spiral-induced AHE, which is expected to occur across a wide range of materials hosting commensurate spin spirals.

Abstract: Diffusive approximations of Markov jump processes often fail to accurately capture large fluctuations. This is confounding, as the rare events triggered by these large fluctuations, such as the failure of electronic memories, are often the object of interest. In this paper we present an improved diffusive approximation, extending a method previously limited to equilibrium systems. Using new tools from stochastic thermodynamics, we prove its validity to linear order in departures from equilibrium and demonstrate its superior accuracy over the Kramers-Moyal expansion in predicting both steady-state and transient properties, including the error rate of a non-equilibrium electronic memory.

Abstract: The rapidly growing class of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials is intensely investigated both in the context of fundamental science and for new technologies. There is in this connection a widespread need for new ways to probe the electronic properties of these layered materials, since their two-dimensional (2D) character make conventional probes less efficient. Here, we show how excitons trapped in a moiré lattice can be used as an optical probe for spatially resolved electron spin density correlations in such materials. The electrons in the material of interest virtually tunnel to the moiré lattice where they scatter on the excitons after which they tunnel back. This gives rise to an effective spin-dependent and spatially localised potential felt by the electrons, which in turn leads to energy shifts that can be measured spectroscopically in the exciton spectrum. Using second order perturbation theory combined with a solution to the exciton-electron scattering problem, we show that the electrons mediate an interaction between two excitons resulting in an energy shift proportional to their two-point spin density-density correlation function evaluated at the exciton positions. We then discuss two specific applications of our setup. First, we show that quantum phase transitions between different in-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders in a 2D lattice give rise to large and measurable shifts in the exciton spectrum in the critical regions. Second, we analyse how different pairing symmetries of superconducting phases can be probed. This demonstrates that our scheme opens up new ways to probe electron spin density correlations, which is a key property of many quantum phases predicted to exist in the new 2D materials.

Abstract: Strain engineering enables quantum confinement in pristine graphene without degrading its intrinsic mobility and spin coherence. Here, we extend previously proposed strain-induced charge-qubit architectures by incorporating spin degrees of freedom through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Zeeman fields, enabling spin-qubit operation in single-layer graphene (SLG). In a graphene p-n junction, a strain-induced nanobubble generates a pseudo-magnetic field that forms double quantum dots with gate-tunable level hybridization. Tight-binding quantum transport simulations and a four-band model reveal two distinct avoided crossings: spin-conserving gaps at zero detuning and spin-flip gaps at finite detuning, the latter increasing with SOC strength while the former decreases. Time-domain simulations confirm detuning-dependent Rabi oscillations corresponding to these two operational regimes. These results demonstrate that strain-induced confinement combined with tunable SOC provides a viable mechanism for coherent spin manipulation in pristine graphene, positioning strained SLG as a promising platform for scalable spin-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: We analyze theoretically THz response of an electron-hole pair confined in a semiconductor nanoparticle. We show that the interplay of particle confinement and electron-hole Coulomb interaction leads to significant renormalizations and energy shifts in THz linear conductivity of the nanocrystal. We develop and evaluate models in the strong and the weak confinement regime in order to correctly address the effect of Coulomb interaction. In the weak confinement regime, we find solutions of the problem in a form similar to the Wannier wavefunction whose spatial extent is reduced as a consequence of the confinement. The resulting states are scalable down to the strong confinement regime, enabling a theoretical description of the exciton response for arbitrarily sized nanoparticles.

Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $τ_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $τ_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,μ{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mechanical degrees of freedom very weakly couple to spins in semiconductors. The inefficient coupling between phonons and single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hinders their integration into on-chip acoustically coupled quantum hybrid systems. We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\% fidelity. Applying our advancement could enable acoustic QD spin state transfer to diverse solid-state systems and transduction between acoustic, optical, and microwave domains, all within an on-chip integration-ready setting.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin-resolved thermoelectric transport in a triangular ladder geometry hosting antiferromagnetic spin alignment, where lattice topology and magnetic ordering jointly enable highly efficient spin-selective energy conversion. The inherent geometric frustration of the ladder, together with intrinsic spin-filtering mechanisms, is shown to promote a pronounced separation between spin channels. Implementing spin-dependent onsite modulations, such as binary asymmetric potentials, induces pronounced spin splitting in the transmission spectrum, enabling controlled spin-selective transport and highlighting the role of lattice engineering in tailoring spin-dependent thermoelectric response. Additional control is achieved through modulation of the hopping amplitudes, which activates multiple transport pathways and allows fine tuning of spin-dependent conduction. A detailed evaluation of charge and spin thermoelectric coefficients reveals a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric performance, with the dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaching large values in optimized parameter regimes. Notably, the spin figure of merit systematically surpasses its charge counterpart, underscoring the decisive role of lattice geometry and antiferromagnetic order in amplifying spin thermoelectric efficiency. Our findings provide a versatile theoretical platform for designing low-dimensional spin-caloritronic devices with enhanced functionality.

Motivation: 旨在探索绝缘交替磁体在自旋电子学领域的新应用，特别是在磁性跑道存储器等设备中的潜力，并为实验上识别这类材料中的交替磁性提供一个标志性特征。

Abstract: We develop a theory of thermomagnonic torques in insulating altermagnets and predict a spin-splitter magnonic torque arising from the spin Seebeck effect. Additionally, we predict an anisotropic entropic torque. We study the effects of these torques on magnetic-texture dynamics and identify various anisotropic responses to temperature gradients. In particular, we predict spin-current-induced domain-wall precession, which can slow domain-wall motion for certain temperature-gradient directions. We also predict a temperature-gradient-driven anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect that enables fast skyrmion motion in response to thermal gradients. Our findings will be useful for spintronic applications such as magnetic racetrack memories and will serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in insulating altermagnets with magnetic textures.

### [53] [Improved Standard-Model predictions for $η^{(\prime)}\to \ell^+ \ell^-$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13776)
*Noah Messerli,Martin Hoferichter,Bai-Long Hoid,Simon Holz,Bastian Kubis*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文基于对η和η'介子跃迁形状因子的最新理解，精确计算了其衰变为轻子对的概率。通过引入新的色散分析方法，提升了理论预测的精度，发现其中一个过程的理论值与实验值存在轻微偏差，并探讨了其对寻找新物理的意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标准模型中，η和η'介子衰变为轻子对（$η^{(\prime)}	o\ell^+\ell^-$）的稀有过程被高度抑制，因此精确研究这些过程是寻找新物理的理想窗口。最近在研究μ子反常磁矩（g-2）时，学界对η和η'介子的跃迁形状因子有了更深入的理解，这为更精确地计算上述稀有衰变提供了契机。

Method: 该研究采用了基于色散关系的跃迁形状因子（transition form factor）表示方法。此方法首次能够稳健地评估除主导的双光子过程外，其他次级渠道对衰变矩阵元虚部的影响。同时，研究还改进了对包含赝标量介子质量效应的渐近贡献的计算，从而提升了预测精度。

Result: 论文给出了四个稀有衰变过程分支比的最新、最精确的理论预测值：Br[η→e+e−]=5.37×10⁻⁹，Br[η→μ+μ−]=4.54×10⁻⁶，Br[η'→e+e−]=1.80×10⁻¹⁰，以及Br[η'→μ+μ−]=1.22×10⁻⁷。研究发现，η→μ+μ−的理论预测值与现有实验数据存在1.6σ的轻微偏差。

Conclusion: 本研究为η和η'介子衰变为轻子对的过程提供了当前最精确的标准模型理论预测。其中，η→μ+μ−衰变分支比的计算结果与实验值之间的轻微偏差，为探索和限制超出标准模型的新物理提供了线索。这些精确的预测也为未来的实验测量设立了重要的理论基准。

Abstract: The rare decays $η^{(\prime)}\to\ell^+\ell^-$, $\ell\in\{e,μ\}$, are highly suppressed in the Standard Model, both by their chirality structure and the required loop attaching the lepton line to the $η^{(\prime)}\toγ^*γ^*$ matrix element. The latter is described by a single scalar function, the transition form factor, which has recently been studied in great detail for $η^{(\prime)}$ in the context of the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Based on these results, we evaluate the corresponding prediction for the $η^{(\prime)}$ dilepton decays, supplemented by an improved evaluation of the asymptotic contributions including pseudoscalar mass effects. In particular, the dispersive representation for the $η^{(\prime)}$ transition form factors allows us, for the first time, to perform a robust evaluation of the imaginary parts due to subleading channels besides the dominant two-photon cut. Our final results are $\text{Br}[η\to e^+e^-]=5.37(4)(2)[4]\times 10^{-9}$, $\text{Br}[η\to μ^+μ^-]=4.54(4)(2)[4]\times 10^{-6}$, $\text{Br}[η'\to e^+e^-]=1.80(2)(3)[3]\times 10^{-10}$, and $\text{Br}[η'\to μ^+μ^-]=1.22(2)(2)[3]\times 10^{-7}$, where the errors refer to the uncertainty in the normalized branching fraction, the one propagated from $\text{Br}[η^{(\prime)}\toγγ]$, and the total uncertainty, respectively. The branching fraction for $η\toμ^+μ^-$ exhibits a mild $1.6σ$ tension with experiment, and we explore the bounds that can be derived on physics beyond the Standard Model.

TL;DR: 本文推广了一种利用大型中微子探测器（如 JUNO、SNO+、大亚湾等）探测亚GeV暗物质的新方法。通过分析光电倍增管总命中率的年度调制，并同时考虑闪烁和电离两种信号，研究表明该方法具有很强的竞争力，并呼吁多实验合作验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究已证明使用JUNO探测器的闪烁光信号可以有效探测亚GeV暗物质，并超越了现有探测极限。本文旨在对该方法进行显著推广。

Method: 研究方法上，本文将先前的工作从两个方面进行了扩展：1. 在信号通道上，除了原有的闪烁光，新增考虑了电离通道。2. 在实验对象上，将分析从单一的JUNO探测器推广至SNO+、大亚湾、Borexino和KamLAND等多个液体闪烁体探测器。

Result: 结果表明，经过推广后，多个中微子探测器在寻找亚GeV暗物质方面都能达到具有竞争力的灵敏度，其探测能力能够超越专门的暗物质实验，并触及重要的理论模型。

Conclusion: 作者最后呼吁，既然多个探测器都具备了相应的探测能力，各实验之间应抓住机遇，开展合作以交叉验证此项新技术，并利用不同探测器的独特优势来进一步完善该方法。

Abstract: It was recently shown that standard sub-GeV dark matter candidates can be effectively probed by large neutrino observatories via annual modulation of the total photomultiplier hit rate. That work focused on the production of light by the excitation of scintillator molecules and considered the JUNO detector, surpassing limits from dedicated dark-matter detectors and reaching theoretical targets. Here, we significantly generalize that work, now also taking into account ionization channels and extending the analysis to other liquid-scintillator detectors, including SNO+, Daya Bay, Borexino, and KamLAND. Last, we present a call to action: with multiple detectors achieving competitive sensitivity, there is an opportunity to validate this new technique across experiments and to refine it using each detector's strengths.

TL;DR: 本文研究了A₄味对称性自发破缺导致的畴壁（domain walls）的形成，及其湮灭时在不同物理模型下（实标量、复标量、超对称）产生的可区分的随机引力波背景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A₄味对称性模型常被用来解释轻子混合，而其自发破缺会产生畴壁等宇宙学遗迹。本文旨在研究这些畴壁湮灭所产生的引力波信号，从而将粒子物理模型与宇宙学观测联系起来。

Method: 作者分三种情况研究了A₄对称性破缺：分别由实标量场、复标量场和超对称标量场导致。他们分析了每种情况下形成的畴壁（例如，偏置势下的亚稳畴壁、与宇宙弦的相互作用、BPS畴壁等）的特性，并将其与具体的（超对称与非超对称）轻子味模型相结合。

Result: 研究表明，不同的对称性破缺场景会产生性质不同的畴壁，并对应着独特的引力波信号。例如，实标量场情况下的亚稳畴壁会衰变为振荡的双壁系统；复标量场情况下畴壁与全局弦存在相互作用；超对称情况下则存在BPS畴壁。

Conclusion: A₄味对称性的破缺可以产生可观测的引力波。通过分析这些引力波信号的特征，未来将有可能区分导致对称性破缺的标量场的具体物理性质（是实的、复的还是超对称的），为检验粒子物理模型提供了新的途径。

Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of an $A_4$ flavour symmetry, often used to predict leptonic mixing, can lead to the formation of domain walls which can annihilate and generate a stochastic gravitational wave background. We study this phenomenon in three scenarios where the nature of the scalar field responsible for breaking the $A_4$ symmetry spontaneously differs: real, complex, and supersymmetric. For the real scalar, a biased potential produces metastable walls that decay into oscillating two-wall systems with important consequences for gravitational wave signals. In the complex scalar case, we discuss the interplay between domain walls and global strings and classify the types of domain walls that form in terms of the $A_4$ group symmetries. We investigate the properties of supersymmetric $A_4$ domain walls, and highlight the BPS walls. Finally we show how these results may be achieved in leptonic $A_4$ flavour models, with and without supersymmetry, and discuss their distinctive gravitational wave signatures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于机器学习的异常检测方法在寻找新物理现象时，会因“别处效应”（look elsewhere effect）导致统计功效降低和p值（p-values）校准错误的问题。

Method: 作者比较了多种处理数据的方法对p值校准和异常检测灵敏度的影响，包括：在相同数据上训练和测试、数据对半分割、早停法（early stopping）以及k-折交叉验证（k-folding）。研究使用了高斯随机变量和LHC奥运会基准数据集进行验证。

Result: 在相同数据上训练和测试会导致p值严重失准；数据对半分割能完美校准p值但会牺牲灵敏度；而k-折交叉验证在p值校准和检测灵敏度之间取得了最有效的平衡。

Conclusion: k-折交叉验证（k-folding）是在高维空间中进行异常检测时，解决统计挑战并平衡p值校准与检测灵敏度之间权衡的有效策略。

Abstract: Machine learning-based anomaly detection methods are able to search high-dimensional spaces for hints of new physics with much less theory bias than traditional searches. However, by searching in many directions all at once, the statistical power of these search strategies is diluted by a variant of the look elsewhere effect. We examine this challenge in detail, focusing on weakly supervised methods. We find that training and testing on the same data results in badly miscalibrated $p$-values due to the anomaly detector searching everywhere in the data and overfitting on statistical fluctuations. However, if these $p$-values can be calibrated, they may offer the best sensitivity to anomalies, since this approach uses all of the data. Conversely, training on half of the data and testing on the other half results in perfectly calibrated $p$-values, but at the cost of reduced sensitivity to anomalies. Similarly, regularization methods such as early stopping can help with $p$-value calibration but also possibly at the expense of sensitivity. Finally, we find that k-folding strikes an effective balance between calibration and sensitivity. Our findings are supported by numerical studies with Gaussian random variables as well as from collider physics using the LHC Olympics benchmark anomaly detection dataset.

TL;DR: 本文使用第一性原理量子场论方法研究强磁化相对论性等离子体的剪切与体粘滞系数，发现磁场会引起显著的各向异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解强磁化相对论性等离子体（与磁星物理学和重离子碰撞中的夸克-胶子等离子体相关）的输运性质，特别是剪切和体粘滞系数。

Method: 使用第一性原理量子场论方法，在弱耦合近似下，并利用久保（Kubo）的线性响应理论来推导粘滞系数的横向和纵向分量。

Result: 磁场在剪切和体粘滞系数中均引起了显著的各向异性。纵向剪切粘滞系数随磁场增强而增加，横向分量则减小。体粘滞系数的两个分量均先上升后下降。此外，还发现了一个负的交叉粘滞系数，其大小随磁场增强而增加。

Conclusion: 这些关于磁粘滞系数的结果对磁星物理学和重离子碰撞中产生的强磁化夸克-胶子等离子体具有物理意义。同时，研究发现体粘滞系数对声速的纵向和横向分量高度敏感，因此其定量值应谨慎解释。

Abstract: Using first-principles quantum field-theoretical methods, we investigate the shear and bulk viscosities of strongly magnetized relativistic plasmas. The analysis is performed within the weak-coupling approximation and utilizes known results for the fermion damping rates in the Landau-level representation, $Γ_{n}(p_{z})$, which are dominated by one-to-two and two-to-one processes in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The transverse and longitudinal components of the viscosities are derived using Kubo's linear response theory. Our results reveal a pronounced anisotropy in both shear and bulk viscosities induced by the magnetic field. In the case of an electron-positron plasma, where the weak-coupling approximation is well justified, the dimensionless longitudinal shear viscosity $η_{\parallel}/T^3$ increases rapidly with the magnetic field strength, while the transverse component $η_{\perp}/T^3$ decreases and can even drop below the KSS bound at sufficiently large fields. In contrast, both the dimensionless longitudinal and transverse bulk viscosities, $ζ_{\perp}/T^3$ and $ζ_{\parallel}/T^3$, initially rise from small values, reach a maximum, and then gradually decrease toward zero. We find that the bulk viscosity is highly sensitive to the longitudinal and transverse components of the sound velocity, particularly at high magnetic fields, indicating that its quantitative values should be interpreted with caution. We also calculate an additional cross viscosity, which is negative and whose magnitude increases with the magnetic field strength. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of these magnetoviscosity results in the contexts of magnetar physics and the strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions.

*Shyam Balaji,Damon Cleaver,Pedro De la Torre Luque*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个激发暗物质（XDM）模型，该模型能够统一解释来自银河系中心的2 MeV伽马射线超、511 keV谱线和中心分子区电离率这三个独立的观测异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的观测数据显示，银河系中心存在一个约2 MeV的连续伽马射线谱，其空间分布与长期存在的511 keV正电子湮灭线高度吻合。这表明存在一个共同的低能正电子源，但已知的天体物理过程或标准暗物质模型难以解释这一现象。

Method: 论文采用了一个最小化的激发暗物质（XDM）模型。在该模型中，暗物质粒子（χ）被非弹性散射至激发态（χ*），随后退激发（χ*→χe+e−）产生约2 MeV的正电子。研究结合了完整的宇宙射线传播模型进行拟合分析。

Result: 研究发现，当暗物质粒子质量（mχ）约为1.5 TeV，其基态与激发态的质量差（Δm）约为4 MeV，散射截面为3-4×10⁻²³ cm²时，模型可以完美拟合观测数据。此外，该模型产生的正电子还能显著贡献于中心分子区（CMZ）的异常高电离率。

Conclusion: 这是首次使用激发暗物质（XDM）模型统一解释由其诱导的正电子所产生的三个不同天文观测信号（2 MeV连续谱、511 keV谱线和中心分子区电离率）。该工作预测了相关的MeV波段信号，这些信号可由未来针对银河系MeV波段的观测任务进行检验。

Abstract: Recent COMPTEL data analysis reveals a $\sim$ 2 MeV continuum excess whose spatial distribution closely matches the long-standing 511 keV line observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, indicating a common population of low-energy positrons that is difficult to reconcile with known astrophysical sources or standard thermal dark matter (DM). We show that a minimal Excited Dark Matter (XDM) model naturally explains these features. In this scenario a DM particle $χ$ is inelastically upscattered into an excited state $χ^*$, followed by de-excitation $χ^*\toχe^+ e^-$ producing $\sim$2 MeV positrons that reproduce the 511 keV line morphology and the COMPTEL MeV continuum. Using a full cosmic-ray (CR) propagation treatment, we obtain an excellent fit for $m_χ\simeq$ 1.5 TeV DM particle with mass-splitting $Δm =m_{χ^*}-m_χ\simeq$ 4 MeV for an inelastic geometric scattering cross section of $σ_\textrm{mr}= 3-4\times 10^{-23}\,\textrm{cm}^2$. The same positrons supply a substantial, radially flat contribution to the anomalous Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) ionization rate. This is the first unified treatment of XDM-induced positrons across all three observables, yielding correlated MeV signatures testable by upcoming missions targeting the Galactic MeV band.

Abstract: In this work, we derive novel constraints on scalar-tensor theories from neutrino physics. Spatial variations of the background scalar field effectively generate density and position-dependent Standard Model masses, including neutrinos. Neutrinos are a unicum in the SM due to their ability both to propagate over galactic distances and to traverse dense media such as Earth. This makes them an ideal probe of the background scalar field, which can in turn alter flavour oscillations and supernova time delays. As we enter the era of precision neutrino physics, we are compelled to explore such a scenario. We derive expressions for the relevant observables and obtain new bounds on a broad class of scalar-tensor models. We finally map the bounds to popular screening mechanisms models, such as the Symmetron and Chameleon.

Abstract: Freeze-in dark matter has recently garnered significant attention as a promising framework due to its feeble interactions, which are consistent with the null results from dark matter experiments. While previous studies have extensively investigated the production of dark matter through the decay of heavy particles, they overlook the cosmological role of the decaying mediator without justifying this assumption. We emphasize that the mediator can dominate the energy budget of the early universe during its decay, leading to an unavoidable early matter-dominated era. This intrinsic matter-dominated phase influences dark matter production in two key ways: (i) dark matter production occurs in both the early radiation and induced matter-dominated phases; specifically, considerable production occurs in the matter-dominated phase and stops when the mediator decays fully, and (ii) it causes dilution in dark matter abundance due to entropy injection before its saturation. Furthermore, this effect significantly alters the gravitational wave signature associated with the production of freeze-in dark matter through graviton emission during the mediator's decay. Specifically, it enhances the gravitational wave spectrum, making it viable for future high-frequency gravitational wave experiments.

Abstract: This paper examines frameworks and phenomenology of ultrarelativistic Higgs vacuum bubble collisions in a first-order phase transition associated with the Standard Model Higgs field in the early Universe. Such collisions act as a cosmic scale Higgs collider, providing access to energy scales far beyond any temperature reached in our cosmic history, potentially up to the Planck scale. This provides a unique opportunity to probe new physics that couples to the Higgs at very high scales, while also enabling novel applications for various cosmological phenomena, opening tremendous opportunities for particle physics and cosmology. As examples, we demonstrate the viability of nonthermal production of ultra-heavy Higgs portal dark matter up to $10^{16}$ GeV (with observable indirect and direct detection signals up to $m_\text{DM}=O(10)$ TeV), and leptogenesis from the production of GUT scale right-handed neutrinos.

Abstract: Ultralight bosons such as axions and dark photons are well-motivated hypothetical particles, whose couplings to ordinary matter can be effectively constrained by stellar cooling. Limits on these interactions can be obtained by demanding that their emission from the stellar interior does not lead to excessive energy loss. An intriguing question is whether the same microphysical couplings can also be probed through neutron star superradiance, in which gravitationally bound bosonic modes grow exponentially by extracting rotational energy from the star. Although both processes originate from boson-matter interactions, they probe very different kinematic regimes. Stellar cooling probes boson emission at thermal wavelengths, while superradiance is governed by modes whose wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the star. Previous work has attempted to relate the microphysical neutron-nucleon scattering and inverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rates directly to the macroscopic growth rate of superradiant bound states. In this work, we re-examine this connection and show that a naive extrapolation of the microphysical absorption rate to the superradiant regime would imply superradiant rates comparable to astrophysical timescales characterised by pulsar spindown. These naive rates are especially high for vector fields. However, we demonstrate that this conclusion changes once collective multiple-scattering effects in dense nuclear matter are taken into account. Repeated nucleon collisions modify the effective low-energy absorption experienced by the bosonic bound state, strongly suppressing the rate relevant for superradiance.

Abstract: Poincaré-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are used to calculate light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion, $π$, and an analogue state, $π_{s\bar s}$. The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $π_{s\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $π$, $π_{s \bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $π$, $π_{s\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $π$, $π_{s\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). In this connection, it is found that a Gaussian \textit{Ansatz} can only provide a rough guide to TMD pointwise behaviour: magnitude deviations between \textit{Ansatz} and prediction exceed a factor of two on $k_\perp^2 \gtrsim 0.55\,$GeV$^2$. One should therefore be cautious in interpreting conclusions drawn from phenomenological analyses based upon Gaussian \textit{Ansätze}.

Abstract: We develop a unified framework in which the dynamics of a scalar glueball field, originating from phenomenological nonperturbative QCD confinement, simultaneously governs the deconfinement transition of strongly interacting matter and drives cosmological inflation. Starting from a temperature-dependent effective potential $V_{eff}(φ, T)$, we show that the glueball mass vanishes at a critical temperature $T_{cφ}$, signaling a first-order phase transition characterized by supercooling and a transient metastable vacuum. In the high-temperature regime $T > T_{cφ}$, the deconfined phase naturally produces an exponential expansion of the scale factor, providing the correct conditions for inflation. By computing the slow-roll parameters and the resulting spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_s$, and running $α_s$, we confront the model with the Planck observations. The predicted values of $n_s$ and $r_s$ fall within the Planck confidence contours for a broad and physically motivated range of the parameter $γ$ and for $N \approx 50\text{--}60$ e-folds. A distinctive linear relation, $r_s = 4(1-n_s)-72γ$, emerges as a testable signature of the model. Normalization to the observed scalar amplitude further constrains the thermal correction parameter $σ^2$ and the coupling $γ$, linking cosmological data directly to QCD-scale dynamics. These results demonstrate that a confinement-inspired potential can naturally reproduce the observed inflationary phenomenology and offer a novel bridge between early-universe cosmology and the nonperturbative sector of QCD.

Motivation: 利用喷注子结构作为探针，深入理解重离子碰撞中夸克-胶子等离子体（QGP）内部的部分子相互作用。

Method: 采用SHELL输运模型，对铅-铅碰撞中的全举喷注和光子标记喷注（γ+jets）进行系统性的理论研究，并使用了Dynamical和Soft-Drop两种重整化算法。

Result: 1. 理论计算显示，重整化子喷注间的相对横动量（k_T,g）在高值区受到抑制，与ALICE的实验数据一致。
2. 这种抑制源于部分子能量损失和选择偏压导致的喷注半径变窄。
3. 光子标记喷注的半径（R_g）出现加宽，为喷注子结构加宽提供了直接证据。
4. R_g的加宽效应随喷注半径增大而增强，其中Soft Drop算法能更好地解析媒介响应的贡献。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，高k_T,g的抑制是由能量损失和选择偏压共同作用的结果，并非存在增强效应。光子标记喷注的半径R_g加宽为探测QGP中的喷注加宽现象提供了更直接的证据，而Soft Drop算法在此类观测中表现更优，尤其是在大喷注半径下。

Abstract: Jet substructure provides a powerful probe of partonic interactions within the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper, we present a systematic theoretical study of the groomed substructures for both inclusive jets and photon-tagged jets ($γ+$jets) utilizing the Dynamical and Soft-Drop Grooming algorithms in PbPb collisions by employing the SHELL transport model. Our theoretical calculations exhibit a suppression at high $k_{\rm T,g}$, the relative transverse momentum between the two subjets in the groomed substructure, consistent with the recent ALICE measurements. We show that the suppression of high $k_{\rm T,g}$ arises from the combined effects of the reduction of the subleading subjet transverse momentum due to partonic energy loss and the narrowing of the groomed jet radius $R_g$ induced by selection bias. Our findings demonstrate that no enhancement is observed at high $k_{\rm T,g}$, even in the complete absence of selection bias. Furthermore, we propose that the broadening of $R_g$ in photon-tagged jets, which are less susceptible to selection bias compared to inclusive jets, provides relatively direct evidence of the jet substructure broadening. Our analysis reveals that the $R_g$ broadening becomes more pronounced as the jet radius increases, where the medium-induced gluon radiation plays a dominant role in driving such broadening. In particular, we find that as the jet radius increases, the Soft Drop grooming algorithm exhibits a better resolving power for the contribution of the medium response to the jet substructure broadening.

Motivation: 在过去四十多年里，将任意混合矩阵映射到标准参数化的过程一直停留在概念阶段。为了解决这个长期存在的问题，并为CP破坏提供一个透明且通用的描述，作者进行了这项研究。

Conclusion: 该文提出的新公式为CP破坏提供了清晰且普适的描述，可直接应用于低能实验和高能味物理理论。

Abstract: In this letter, we present a fully explicit rephasing transformation that maps an arbitrary mixing matrix to the PDG standard parameterization, a procedure that had remained conceptual for more than four decades. As a result, all six phases of the mixing matrix, including the Dirac and Majorana phases are expressed systematically using only the arguments of matrix elements and the determinant. We further extend this framework to the diagonalization matrices of fermions, allowing the observable CP phases to be expressed by
  fermion-specific Dirac-like phases, Majorana-like phases, and relative phases between different fermion sectors. This formulation provides a transparent and universal description of CP violation, with direct applications to both low-energy experiments and high-energy theories of flavor.

Motivation: 全局拟合在粒子物理学中的角色随着大型强子对撞机（LHC）的数据更新和希格斯玻色子的发现而发生了显著演变。因此，有必要对这一领域的历史、当前作用和未来方向进行一次全面的回顾和梳理。

Abstract: In this work, we review the history and current role of global fits in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model~(BSM), including precision tests of the Standard Model (SM). Although BSM global fits were initially focused on minimal supersymmetric models, we describe how fits have evolved in response to new data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and elsewhere, expanding to encompass a broad spectrum of BSM scenarios including non-minimal supersymmetry, axion-like particles, extended Higgs sectors, dark matter models, and effective field theories such as SMEFT. We discuss how the role of global fits has shifted from forecasting possible signals of new physics at the LHC to understanding the impact of null results from LHC run-I and II and the discovery of the Higgs boson, and how interest has shifted from global fits for parameter estimation to comprehensive model comparison. We close by discussing potential trends and future applications, emphasizing the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of sampling algorithms and comparison between theory and experiment, as well as collaboration and software development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新机制，用于解释非对称暗物质中暗物质与可见物质的质量关系之谜。该机制通过扩展的色群和自发破缺的Z2对称性，将暗物质的禁闭尺度与可见物质的QCD禁闭尺度联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释非对称暗物质模型中，为何暗物质与可见物质的剩余密度惊人地接近（$Ω_D \simeq 5.4Ω_b$）。这需要解释粒子数密度和粒子质量两个方面的关系，本文主要解决后者，即为何暗物质粒子和质子质量相近。

Method: 论文提出一个扩展的 $SU(3)_1 	imes SU(3)_2$ 色群，其中量子色动力学（QCD）是其对角子群。通过一个离散的 $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 交换对称性，将 $SU(3)_2$ 与一个暗的、同样具有禁闭性质的 $SU(3)_D$ 理论联系起来。暗物质是暗费米子的束缚态。这个 $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 对称性的自发破缺，最终导致了QCD与暗规范耦合常数之间的关联。

Result: 该机制成功地使得QCD与暗物质理论的禁闭尺度处于同一数量级，从而解释了两者质量的相似性。此外，模型预测在TeV尺度以上存在丰富的新粒子谱，并自然地包含了一个轴子（axion）来解决强CP问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出的新机制为非对称暗物质中的质量关联问题提供了一个有效的解决方案。该模型不仅解释了暗物质与重子质量的相似性，还提供了可在未来实验中检验的预言，并顺带解决了强CP问题，是一个相当完备和有吸引力的理论框架。

Abstract: Asymmetric dark matter is a well-motivated approach to explain the apparent coincidence between the relic densities of visible and dark matter, $Ω_D \simeq 5.4Ω_b$. A complete explanation requires two components, a relation between the particle masses of the dark and visible matter, and a second relation between the number densities in each sector. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to address the former. We consider an extended $SU(3)_1 \times SU(3)_2$ colour group in the visible sector, with QCD embedded as the diagonal subgroup. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry then relates $SU(3)_2$ to a dark, confining $SU(3)_D$ sector. The dark matter is a composite state of dark fermions transforming in the fundamental representation of $SU(3)_D$. The spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry ultimately leads to a relation between the QCD and dark gauge couplings which, for suitable field content, gives rise to confinement scales of the same order of magnitude. The mechanism leads to a rich particle spectrum above the TeV scale which could be probed at future experiments. The model also naturally includes an axion solution to the strong CP problem.

Motivation: 在壳算符基底下计算有效场论的两圈重整化群（RG）函数时，近期的研究结果出现了非物理性的发散。本文旨在解释并解决这个问题。

Method: 作者在重整化的真空泛函中引入了之前被忽略的“非最小源项”，以维持理论的重整化性质。通过此方法，他们分析了在壳框架下格林函数的重整化群流，并研究了味旋转在其中扮演的角色。

Result: 引入缺失的源项后，RG函数变得有限。任何剩余的发散都被证明是模糊的，并且只产生沿着味旋转方向的非物理RG流，这说明这些发散是理论框架不完整所导致的产物。

Conclusion: 在壳框架下，为了正确描述有效场论的重整化群函数，必须包含非最小源项。这些项对于维持理论的重整化性和获得物理上一致的结果至关重要。

Abstract: Recent results for two-loop renormalization group (RG) functions in effective field theories exhibit unphysical divergences when calculated in an on-shell operator basis. We demonstrate that this can be understood to be a result of omitting non-minimal source terms in the renormalized vacuum functional, which are essential to maintaining renormalizability of and describing the RG flow of Green's functions in an on-shell framework. With the inclusion of the missing source terms, any remaining divergences are ambiguous, generating only unphysical RG flow directed along flavor rotations, and the RG functions are RG-finite. We carefully examine the role of flavor rotations in generating ambiguities in both on- and off-shell RG functions and explore the geometry of a physical coupling space.

Abstract: We study cosmological constraints on the asymmetric mediator scenario, a variant of the scotogenic model that addresses the origins of neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and the baryon asymmetry. An SU(2)$_L$ doublet scalar $η$ mediates between the visible and dark sectors, while a singlet scalar $σ$ serves as the DM candidate. We evaluate the DM relic abundance by solving the Boltzmann equations including $η$ decay and scattering processes prior to the freeze-out of the $η$ asymmetry, and show Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints from late-time $η$ decays. Combining the DM abundance and BBN bounds, we find the favored parameter space of this model, for instance, the mediator masses of $m_η\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多标量、高阶次的一环积分时可能不够通用或复杂。本文旨在提供一个系统性的、算法化的方法来获得解析结果。

Method: 该方法利用了一环积分在维度调节因子ε=0时与双曲单形体积之间的联系。首先，使用纯数学中的算法将此体积（即ε=0时的积分）用多重对数函数表示。然后，通过对ε=0的结果进行一次积分，来获得更高阶的ε展开项。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种强大且系统的新方法，用于解析计算一类重要的一环积分。该方法巧妙地连接了物理学（费曼积分）和纯数学（双曲几何），为高能物理中的高精度计算提供了新的算法途径。

Abstract: We present a method to obtain analytic results in terms of multiple polylogarithms for one-loop triangle, box and pentagon integrals depending on an arbitrary number of scales and to any desired order in the Laurent expansion in the dimensional regulator $\varepsilon$. Our method leverages the fact that for $\varepsilon=0$ one-loop integrals compute volumes of simplices in hyperbolic spaces, which can always be evaluated in terms of polylogarithms using an algorithm recently introduced in pure mathematics. The higher orders in $\varepsilon$ can then be expressed as a one-fold integral involving the result for $\varepsilon=0$. Remarkably, we find that for up to five external legs, all integrals can be evaluated algorithmically in terms of polylogarithms using direct integration techniques, which, in particular, requires us to rationalise all appearing square roots. We also discuss how we can use the connection to hyperbolic geometry to perform the analytic continuation from the Euclidean region to other kinematic regions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双轻子产额是探测夸克-胶子等离子体（QGP）的关键探针，但这篇论文旨在研究局部加速度这一因素如何影响双轻子产额，从而更精确地理解QGP的性质。

Method: 作者将加速度视为微小扰动，在虚时计算框架下，使用加速系中的热狄拉克传播子来计算光子极化张量，并提取其虚部，最终通过与零加速度情况对比来分离出加速度的贡献。

Result: 计算结果明确了加速度对双轻子产额的具体贡献。通过与无加速度情况的对比，论文量化了这一影响。

Conclusion: 局部加速度对作为夸克-胶子等离子体（QGP）探针的双轻子产率有明确且可计算的影响。在利用双轻子探测QGP时，应考虑加速度效应。

Abstract: Dilepton production is one of the key probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) that encodes the imaginary part of the electromagnetic current-current correlator. We investigate the effect of local acceleration on the dilepton production by treating acceleration as a small perturbation. Using the thermal Dirac propagator in an accelerated frame within the imaginary-time formalism, we compute the photon polarization tensor and extract its imaginary part. Comparison with the zero-acceleration case isolates the distinct contributions of acceleration to dilepton yields.

*Alan Price*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 该论文为CERN的MUonE实验提供了高精度的理论预测，通过一种新的计算方法（重求和+高阶修正）显著降低了理论不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CERN的MUonE实验旨在通过分析μ子与电子的散射来精确测量QED耦合常数中强子部分的贡献。为了实现这一目标，需要对该散射过程进行极为精确的理论预测，以减小理论不确定性。

Method: 研究人员首次对μ子-电子散射过程中的软光子和软共线对数进行了全阶微扰重求和（all-order resummation），并将其与完整的次领头阶（NLO）及主要的次次领头阶（NNLO）高阶修正项进行了匹配。

Result: 研究发现，重求和技术在信号区域中起主导作用，而将重求和与高阶修正相匹配的方法显著降低了微扰理论带来的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的计算方法为MUonE实验提供了当前最先进的理论预测，其对理论不确定性的显著压低，对于实验最终能否精确测量基本物理量至关重要。

Abstract: The proposed fixed-target experiment, MUonE, at CERN will aim to measure the hadronic contribution to the running of the QED coupling by analysing the scattering of muons on electrons. Here we present state-of-the-art predictions for the process $μ^{\pm}e^-\rightarrowμ^{\pm}e^-$, where for the first time an all-order resummation of soft and soft-collinear logarithms has been performed. Further, we match this resummation with the complete next-to-leading and the dominant next-to-next-to-leading higher-order corrections. We find that the resummation has a dominant effect in the signal region, while the systematic matching significantly reduces the perturbative uncertainty.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文利用ATLAS和CMS的公开数据，通过SModelS工具重新分析了对电弱超对称的限制，并探讨了统计组合分析的优势，最终指出了目前仍未被排除的轻电弱超对称粒子参数空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ATLAS合作组最近公开了其对超对称模型（pMSSM）的大规模扫描数据及相应的实验限制。这为使用SModelS等工具进行独立的再分析、以及结合CMS实验结果进行更全面的研究提供了契机。

Method: 研究人员使用ATLAS公开的数据集和限制条件，通过SModelS v3.0软件尝试重现ATLAS的分析结果。随后，他们将CMS实验的公开结果也纳入分析，并应用统计组合方法来评估不同分析的综合效果。

Result: 研究表明，结合CMS的结果以及进行统计组合后，对超对称参数空间的限制变得更强。尽管大型强子对撞机（LHC）的限制非常严格，研究仍然找到了轻电弱超对称粒子（electroweak-inos）存活的参数空间区域。

Conclusion: 为了最大化地提升实验敏感度并填补超对称参数空间中的漏洞，必须采用广泛且多方面结合的分析策略，这意味着需要结合不同实验（如ATLAS和CMS）的结果并使用更全面的方法。

Abstract: The ATLAS collaboration has recently performed a vast scan of the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM) with a focus on the electroweak-ino sector, and analysed how their Run 2 searches for electroweak production of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles constrain this dataset. All the SLHA files from the scan as well as the constraints from the eight individual searches considered by ATLAS were made publicly available. We use this material to study how well the ATLAS constraints can be reproduced with SModelS v3.0. Moreover, we explore how the picture changes when also including CMS results, and what can be gained by the statistical combination of analyses. Finally, we discuss the part of parameter space with light electroweak-inos that remains valid despite the stringent LHC limits. Our results underscore the need of a broad, multifaceted approach for maximising sensitivity and closing loopholes in the extensive SUSY parameter space.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 该论文分析了SU(N)纯杨-米尔斯理论在禁闭相变过程中产生的引力波谱。研究发现，尽管在N=20时信号最强，但总体信号仍然相当微弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用最新的格点模拟数据，特别是关于大N极限下表面张力的新发现，来更精确地预测SU(N)理论在禁闭相变时产生的引力波信号，并阐明其在大N极限下的行为。

Method: 研究采用了有效的波利亚科夫圈 (Polyakov loop) 模型来描述相变，并结合了最新的格点数据来修正模型的动能项。同时，研究人员基于相变过程中的大焓变，估算了气泡壁的速度，并将其与薄壁近似方法进行了比较。

Result: 研究发现，薄壁近似在N较小时与模型符合得很好，但在大N时失效。引力波信号在N=20时最强，但所有预测的信号总体上都比较弱。

Conclusion: 这项工作为所有SU(N)群的禁闭相变引力波信号提供了可靠预测，并澄清了其在大N极限下的特性。虽然信号微弱，但该研究为未来探索其他规范群以及包含费米子的系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the gravitational wave spectrum of $SU(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory. The confinement phase transition is described with an effective Polyakov loop model, using the latest lattice data as an input. In particular, recent lattice studies clarified the large-$N$ scaling of the surface tension, which we incorporate through a modification of the kinetic term. We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak. Our work paves the way for future studies of other gauge groups and systems with fermions.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了“共线 twist-3 因子分解”和“横向动量依赖 (TMD) 因子分解”这两种理论在描述超子极化过程时的一致性，发现在它们共同适用的范围内，两者的计算结果可以匹配，证明了它们是描述同一物理现象的互补框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在中间横向动量区域（Λ_QCD ≪ P_T ≪ Q），共线 twist-3 和 TMD 这两种理论框架都应有效。本文旨在检验这两种框架在此区域内是否一致，以验证它们对物理过程描述的正确性。

Method: 作者分别使用 twist-3 因子分解（关注 twist-3 碎裂函数）和 TMD 因子分解（关注 TMD 极化碎裂函数）来计算超子产生的截面。通过将 TMD 极化碎裂函数用 twist-3 碎裂函数表示，进而在两种框架都适用的动量区域内对计算结果进行匹配和比较。

Result: 计算结果显示，两种框架的描述是匹配的。当用 twist-3 碎裂函数表示 TMD 极化碎裂函数后，得到的 TMD 因子分解公式与 twist-3 截面在小横向动量极限下的结果一致。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，共线 twist-3 因子分解和横向动量依赖 (TMD) 因子分解这两种理论框架，在描述相同的 QCD 效应上是一致的。它们是互补的，分别适用于描述不同运动学区域中的物理过程。

Abstract: We investigate the consistency between the collinear twist-3 factorization and the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization for the transversely polarized hyperon production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, $ep\to eΛ^\uparrow X$. In particular, we focus on the contributions from the twist-3 fragmentation functions (FFs) and the TMD polarizing FF in the region of the hyperon's intermediate transverse momentum $P_T$, $Λ_{\rm QCD}\ll P_T\ll Q$, where both frameworks are valid. In this region the polarizing FF can be expressed in terms of the twist-3 FFs including the purely gluonic ones, and the resulting TMD factorization formula for $ep\to eΛ^\uparrow X$ agrees with the small-$P_T$ limit of the corresponding twist-3 cross section. This matching of the two calculations indicates that the two frameworks describe the same effect in QCD and provide complementary frameworks for the process in different kinematic regions.

TL;DR: 本文在双希格斯二重态模型中，对带电希格斯玻色子对的产生进行了更高精度的理论计算（NLO QCD修正），显著降低了理论不确定性，为未来实验提供了更可靠的理论支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标准模型之外的新物理模型中，研究带电希格斯玻色子对的产生过程有助于我们理解其相互作用（即三线性耦合）。为了能够精确地解读未来可能的实验观测数据，需要进行高精度的理论计算。

Method: 作者在双希格斯二重态模型（2HDM）的框架下，计算了带电希格斯玻色子对 ($H^+H^-$) 产生的次领头阶（NLO）QCD修正。分析过程全面涵盖了Drell-Yan类产生、胶子融合以及矢量玻色子融合这三种主要产生模式，并评估了来自标度、部分子密度函数和强耦合常数 $\alpha_s$ 的不确定性。

Result: 研究发现，在考虑了次领头阶QCD修正后，理论预测结果对能量标度的依赖性显著降低。这表明修正后的预测更加稳定和精确。

Conclusion: 这些经过改进的理论预测，为未来在大型强子对撞机（LHC）等实验上寻找并解释带电希格斯粒子信号提供了更可靠的定量分析依据。

Abstract: Charged Higgs-boson pair production at hadron colliders yields information about the trilinear couplings involving charged Higgs fields in extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We consider the two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) extension and obtain next-to-leading order QCD predictions for the charged-Higgs pair production ($H^+H^-$ production). All production modes, i.e. Drell--Yan-like production, gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion are included in the analysis. We determine uncertainties originating from the scale dependence, the parton-density functions and strong coupling $α_s$ at the LHC. We observe that the QCD corrections lead to a significant reduction of the relative scale dependences. These improved predictions will allow for a quantitative interpretation of experimental measurements, in case that charged Higgs states will be observed.

TL;DR: 这篇论文计算了B介子非轻子衰变中的新物理效应，补全了重夸克展开（HQE）理论到特定阶数（六维算符）的计算，特别是之前缺失的弱湮灭贡献。这些结果对于解释B介子寿命以及相关实验与理论的偏差至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前，在一些B介子非轻子衰变中，实验测量与基于标准模型的理论预测存在偏差。这表明可能存在超出标准模型（BSM）的新物理学。为了系统地研究这些新物理对B介子寿命和寿命比（如 $τ(B^0_s)/τ(B^0_d)$）的影响，需要一个更完整的理论计算框架。

Method: 论文从描述b夸克非轻子衰变的最通用有效哈密顿量出发，在重夸克展开（HQE）的理论框架下，解析性地计算了所有双夸克算符在质量维度六阶以内的匹配系数。此外，作者还计算了之前缺失的、在六维算符下四夸克算符匹配中出现的弱湮灭贡献。

Result: 论文完成了对B介子非轻子树级衰变中新物理效应的计算。作者给出了直到六维算符的双夸克算符的完整解析表达式，并补全了弱湮灭的贡献。作为副产品，他们还确定了标准模型内QCD企鹅算符引起的匹配系数，并得到了色磁算符（五维）和达尔文算符（六维）的新结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作补全了在重夸克展开（HQE）框架下，超出标准模型（BSM）效应对B介子寿命影响的理论计算。其结果为精确检验各种新物理模型提供了必要的理论工具，并为理解相关实验数据与理论预测的差异铺平了道路。

Abstract: Starting from the most general effective Hamiltonian describing non-leptonic $b$-quark decays $b\to q_1 \bar q_2 q_3$, we compute analytic expressions for all matching coefficients of the two-quark operator contributions in the heavy quark expansion~(HQE) of a $B$ meson, up to mass-dimension-six. In addition, we calculate the weak-annihilation contributions, which enter the matching of four-quark operators in the HQE at dimension-six and were previously missing. Our results complete the calculation of beyond Standard Model effects in non-leptonic, tree-level, $b$-quark decays relevant for $B$ meson lifetimes and lifetime ratios such as $τ(B^0_s)/τ(B^0_d)$. Such effects naturally arise in extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that aim to address the observed tensions between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions based on QCD factorisation in several colour-allowed non-leptonic $B$-meson decays. As a by-product of our calculation, we also determine the matching coefficients in the HQE induced by the QCD-penguin operators within the SM, including both the interference between current-current and penguin operators and the contributions quadratic in the penguin operators. Owing to the suppression of the QCD-penguin Wilson coefficients within the SM, these effects are typically regarded as corrections of order $α_s$ and $α_s^2$ in the strong coupling, respectively. Our results reproduce the known expressions at dimension-three and provide new results for the coefficients of the chromomagnetic operator at dimension-five and of the Darwin operator at dimension-six.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个结合惰性双峰模型（IDM）和精质场的理论，旨在统一解释宇宙的早期暴胀和晚期加速膨胀。研究发现，该模型要符合现有观测数据，其关键耦合参数需要非常小；但这又与量子引力理论（沼泽地猜想）的要求产生了显著矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这篇论文的动机是构建一个统一的理论框架，该框架能够同时描述宇宙早期的暴胀时期和晚期的加速膨胀。为了实现这一目标，研究者们探索了一个基于惰性双峰模型（Inert Doublet Model, IDM）的场景，并将其与一个通过指数势耦合的精质场（quintessence field）相结合。

Method: 该研究采用了从约旦参考系（Jordan frame）到爱因斯坦参考系（Einstein frame）的共形变换方法。通过这种变换，他们从一个基于惰性双峰模型（IDM）和精质场（quintessence field）相互作用的理论出发，推导出了一个有效的、受指数因子调制的类Starobinsky暴胀势。随后，他们分析了这个双场系统的动力学行为，计算了慢滚参数、原初扰动谱以及关键的暴胀观测量（光谱指数ns和张量标量比r），并将其与最新的观测数据进行对比。

Result: 研究发现，为了使模型的预测与最新的宇宙微波背景辐射（CMB）数据相符，精质场与暴胀场的耦合常数（β）必须极弱，其数值需要在β ≲ 4x10⁻³的量级。然而，另一方面，量子引力领域的沼泽地dS猜想（swampland dS conjecture）则倾向于一个更大的耦合常数（β ~ O(1)）。这两个要求之间存在显著的矛盾，揭示了在宇宙学可行性与量子引力一致性之间的紧张关系。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，在所提出的模型中，为了与当前的宇宙学观测数据（如普朗克和BICEP/Keck的数据）保持一致，暴胀场与精质场的耦合常数β必须非常小。然而，这与量子引力中的沼泽地猜想（Swampland Conjecture）所要求的较大的β值存在显著的张力。因此，需要进一步探讨可能的扩展或稳定机制，以调和暴胀预测与沼泽地约束之间的矛盾。

Abstract: We study a quintessential inflation scenario based on the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) coupled to a quintessence field via an exponential potential $V_0e^{-βφ/M_p}$. Using a conformal transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame, we derive an effective Starobinsky-type potential modulated by an exponential factor that naturally unifies the inflationary epoch with the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. We analyze the resulting two-field dynamics, compute the slow-roll parameters, the primordial perturbation spectrum, as well as the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$, and then confront the predictions with the latest $Planck$ and $BICEP/Keck$ data. We find amongst others that the quintessence inflaton coupling must remain extremely weak, in the order of $β\lesssim 4\times10^{-3}$, to satisfy current $CMB$ data, whereas swampland dS conjecture favors a step potential with $β\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, signaling a significant tension between quantum gravity consistency and cosmological viability. We conclude by discussing possible extensions and stabilization mechanisms that could help reconcile the inflationary predictions with swampland constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究恒速运动的电荷在各向同性手性物质中的切伦科夫辐射现象。

Method: 作者使用了Carroll-Field-Jackiw电动力学理论，在柱坐标和空间-频率域中求解修正的麦克斯韦方程，通过施加因果关系来获得色散关系，从而推导出电磁场的闭合表达式。

Result: 研究发现，光谱能量分布是规范不变且为正的。在特定频率范围内，可以形成零个、一个或两个切伦科夫锥。值得注意的是，模型中的一个特定扇区允许来自缓慢移动电荷的无阈值切伦科夫辐射。

Conclusion: 该研究阐明了在各向同性手性物质中产生切伦科夫辐射的机制和条件，并统一了先前在非相对论极限下的部分发现。

Abstract: We investigate Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, with an axion angle linear in time, to describe a charge moving at constant velocity. By solving the modified Maxwell's equations in cylindrical coordinates and in the space-frequency domain, we derive closed expressions for the circularly polarized electromagnetic fields contributing independently to the radiation. The dispersion relations are obtained by imposing causality at a cylindrical surface at infinity, ensuring outgoing waves. Contrary to initial suppositions, each spectral energy distribution is gauge-invariant and positive, describing radiation at a characteristic angle. We characterize the angles and identify frequency ranges that allow for zero, one, or two Cherenkov cones. Notably, one sector of the model enables threshold-free Cherenkov radiation from slowly moving charges. Our results agree with partial findings in the nonrelativistic limit of earlier iterative analysis and clarify the regimes in which Cherenkov radiation arises in isotropic chiral matter.
