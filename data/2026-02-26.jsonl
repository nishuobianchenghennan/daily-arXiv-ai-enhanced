We show that the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on neutrinos produce the lepton asymmetry $\\sim 10^{-10}$ which subsequently produces the baryon asymmetry. We consider the Dirac Lagrangian in curved spacetime in local coordinates exhibiting Hermitian pseudo-vector and non-Hermitian vector terms. These terms lead to energy splitting between weakly interacting neutrinos and antineutrinos, resulting in their unequal number densities and hence a lepton asymmetry. While the non-Hermitian effect leads to a non-conserved total probability of neutrinos, the leptogenesis due to gravitational effects of a PBH could be significant until the nucleosynthesis era. This in turn produces baryon asymmetry from the symmetry of lepton and baryon numbers via the sphaleron process in the electro-weak era. We show that in the most conservative scenario, the PBHs of mass $\\sim 10^{12}$ g and spin $\\sim 0.01$ produce the observed baryogenesis at temperature 130 GeV, when such PBHs are available abundantly. However, massive PBHs also could produce the observed asymmetry, assuming the non/anti-Hermitian vector couplings for neutrino and anti-neutrino get canceled from the Lagrangian, leading the system to be Hermitian."}

Classical post-processing yields physical amplitudes and differential cross sections that can be directly compared with collider data. As a proof of concept, we compute unpolarised angular distributions and perform binned likelihood fits to precision electron-positron measurements. The extracted bounds are statistically consistent with Standard Model expectations, demonstrating that quantum-assisted amplitude evaluation can interface directly with phenomenological analyses and experimental data.

On the backdrop of the precision era of neutrino oscillation, this thesis underscores its relevance by demonstrating the physics reach of the forthcoming long-baseline experiments -- Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) -- to establish non-maximal $θ_{23}$, resolve the correct $θ_{23}$ octant, and improve the precision on $θ_{23}$ and $Δm^2_{31}$ by efficiently breaking parameter degeneracies. This is enabled by DUNE's high-resolution LArTPC detector and its wide-band beam, achieving sensitivity at a high confidence level compared to the global fits of world neutrino data. The combined analysis of DUNE and Hyper-K not only significantly enhances sensitivity to these phenomenological studies but also demonstrates their capabilities at lower exposures when operated together, relative to their nominal individual exposures. In addition, we investigate the impact of flavor-dependent long-range interactions arising from anomaly-free U(1)' extensions of the Standard Model, showing that although subdominant long-range interactions can substantially influence the sensitivity and precision of oscillation parameter measurements, the complementary strengths of DUNE and Hyper-K mitigate these challenges to a large extent."}

Although there are some known strategies to suppress charge noise, one approach is to engineer an isotropic g-factor. In this work we analyze how qubit confinement profile affects the g-factor of hole-spin qubits. We show that decreasing the characteristic in-plane qubit confinement length reduces the g-factor anisotropy. We perform analytical and numerical analysis to compare two types of quantum wells: square wells and parabolic wells. We show that square wells have limited tunability, while parabolic wells offer broader tunability, making them more promising for qubit engineering."}

Moreover, because one prerequisite for the Elzerman and Pauli spin blockade readout mechanisms typical of semiconductor spin qubits is tunneling of electrons between sites, these read-out modalities are unavailable in MSQs. Here, we theoretically demonstrate electrical read-out of entangled MSQs via driven many-electron spin unpolarized currents. In particular, using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach we simulate a maximally entangled MSQ pair between two electronic leads. Driving itinerant electrons between the two leads, we find that the conductance is greater when the MSQs are in the entangled singlet state as compared to the entangled triplet state. This contrast in conductance is enhanced when the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is large and for narrow bandwidth. Our results are readily applicable to molecules supramolecularly functionalizing semiconductors with relatively flat bands such as single-wall carbon nanotubes under a magnetic field."}

When photoexcitation transiently suppresses the double-well barrier, polarization dynamics become strongly nonlinear, while the coherent phonon dynamics remain harmonic. This decoupling cannot be described by a single adiabatic coordinate for the electronic polarization and ionic positions.

The method is comprehensively benchmarked with a dataset of over 44,000 simulated liquid-phase IR spectra for mixtures and achieves up to 90% accuracy in identifying molecular components across a dataset of binary and ternary liquid mixtures. Our strategy is robust to perturbation of spectra, and its accuracy is capped by near-identical liquid-phase IR spectra that limit the resolution of chemical identification, imposing theoretical limits on achieving perfect accuracy in structure identification. Finally, we apply the method to automatically interpret IR spectra in experimental settings, correctly identifying the components of nearly all samples within a blind study.

Using both numerical simulations and analytical reasoning, we show that exact QMBS exhibit slow thermalization, with a timescale scaling as $τ\\sim \\mathcal{O}(λ^{-1/d})$ owing to the stabilizing restricted spectrum-generating algebra (RSGA), which is a significant improvement over previous bounds (e.g., $τ\\sim \\mathcal{O}(λ^{-1/(d+1)})$). Counterintuitively, approximate QMBS can thermalize even more slowly under generic perturbations, exhibiting $τ\\sim \\mathcal{O}(λ^{-2})$ scaling due to second-order perturbative effects in the absence of such protective structure.

We demonstrate ionic transistors consisting of single sub 10 nm nanopores drilled in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with internal gate electrodes made of few layer graphene. These devices deliver up to 10fold current modulation at gate voltages as low as 0.3 V in 10 mM KCl, and 2fold modulation at near physiological 100 mM KCl. Baseline conductance with no gate shows surface charge dominated transport below 100 mM KCl consistent with negatively charged hBN walls and 5 nm opening of the pores. The surface charge and the electrochemical asymmetry introduced by the three electrode configuration govern the device behavior: negative gate voltage (VG) enriches ionic concentrations and enhances current, whereas positive VG induces a local depletion zone that suppresses transport. The current modulation by VG is dependent on the polarity of the transmembrane potential and leads to ion current rectification. Molecular dynamics simulations of a nanopore in a hBN graphene hBN stack reveal confinement and surface charge dependent suppression of relative permittivity of interfacial water. Continuum modeling with radially varying interfacial water permittivity reproduces the asymmetric IV characteristics and explains how the embedded gate sculpts local potential and ion concentrations.

Phys. Soc. Jpn. (Letter)", "summary": "We report an ambient-pressure Dirac electron (DE) state in a new organic conductor, $α$-(BETS)$_2$AuCl$_2$ (BETS = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene). This salt exhibits characteristic transport properties, including large positive in-plane and anomalous negative interlayer magnetoresistance. These signatures closely resemble the high-pressure DE states of $α$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$ (ET = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene). First-principles calculations including spin-orbit coupling identify the electronic state as a quasi-three-dimensional massive Dirac semimetal with residual Fermi pockets. This discovery provides a valuable platform for exploring bulk Dirac fermions without the complexity of high-pressure measurements."}

We demonstrate ionic transistors consisting of single sub 10 nm nanopores drilled in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with internal gate electrodes made of few layer graphene. These devices deliver up to 10fold current modulation at gate voltages as low as 0.3 V in 10 mM KCl, and 2fold modulation at near physiological 100 mM KCl. Baseline conductance with no gate shows surface charge dominated transport below 100 mM KCl consistent with negatively charged hBN walls and 5 nm opening of the pores. The surface charge and the electrochemical asymmetry introduced by the three electrode configuration govern the device behavior: negative gate voltage (VG) enriches ionic concentrations and enhances current, whereas positive VG induces a local depletion zone that suppresses transport. The current modulation by VG is dependent on the polarity of the transmembrane potential and leads to ion current rectification. Molecular dynamics simulations of a nanopore in a hBN graphene hBN stack reveal confinement and surface charge dependent suppression of relative permittivity of interfacial water. Continuum modeling with radially varying interfacial water permittivity reproduces the asymmetric IV characteristics and explains how the embedded gate sculpts local potential and ion concentrations. By enabling sub 0.5 V control of ionic transport at up to 100 mM salt concentrations, these devices address a key barrier in nanofluidics and open the pathway to low power ionic circuits and biosensing."}

Noncollinear spin textures are essential for realizing many emergent quantum transport phenomena. However, driving such spin structures requires precise control of the interfacial magnetic coupling in complex oxide heterostructures. Here, by utilizing competing exchange interactions at the interface between ferromagnetic metal SrRuO3 and ferromagnetic insulator LaCoO3, we discovered a noncollinear spin configuration in SrRuO3 sublayers. Magnetic stripes were induced by out-of-plane rather than in-plane magnetic fields, indicating strong anisotropy pinning in our superlattices. The observed magneto-transport anisotropy is well explained by our proposed spin configurations, accounting for contributions from both bulk and interface of the SrRuO3 layers. More interestingly, magnetic skymionic textures were absent even at high magnetic fields. The interfacial exchange interaction overwhelms the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that stabilizes skyrmions, featuring a higher exchange coupling energy than that for the topological spin textures. Our work highlights the potential of interfacial engineering in tuning the spintronic properties by designing proper interfacial interactions."}
