Accurate predictions for the axion abundance require a detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of cosmic strings and domain walls, which are inevitably produced in this scenario. Most existing studies rely on large-scale numerical simulations of the classical equations of motion, which are subject to significant systematic uncertainties. In this contribution, we briefly review the main features of the post-inflationary scenario and the current limitations in the literature, and present preliminary results from a new analytical framework for axion domain wall networks. Our approach is based on nonequilibrium quantum field theory. It employs the two-particle-irreducible effective action to derive effective Fokker-Planck equations for macroscopic quantities such as the average energy density and root-mean-square velocity of the network.We discuss the relevance of thermal, self-interactions, plasma-induced and quantum effects for cosmological axion abundance estimates, with applications to QCD axions and high-mass axion-like particles."}

We propose a mechanism in which non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model (SM) particles accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, inducing their premature collapse into BH seeds having the same mass as the parent star. Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations."}

This work addresses two objectives: providing an up-to-date determination of $α_s$ using NNLO calculations and a sensitive nucleon data set within a self-consistent framework, and critically assessing the robustness of the $α_s(M_Z)$ extraction in light of systematic uncertainties as well as correlations of $α_s(M_Z)$ with the functional forms of PDFs and other model parameters. In regard to the uncertainty assessment, we demonstrate that some commonly used criteria, including the dynamical tolerance and Bayesian hierarchical models, may produce significantly different or even unstable estimates for the net $α_s$ uncertainty, and we introduce a concept of \\textit{data-clustering safety} that the replicable uncertainty estimates must satisfy. Based on this in-depth examination of the CT25 global hadronic data set using a combination of analysis methods, and after demonstrating a weak correlation between $α_s$ and the functional forms of CT25 PDF parametrizations, we find $α_s(M_Z)=0.1183^{+0.0023}_{-0.0020}$ at the 68\\% credibility level."}

In this work we present BSFfast, a lightweight numerical tool that provides precomputed, tabulated effective BSF cross sections for a wide class of phenomenologically relevant models, including highly excited bound states and, where applicable, the full network of radiative bound-to-bound transitions. We exploit rescaling relations of the cross section to efficiently cover models with additional free parameters and provide fast interpolation routines in Mathematica, python and C for use in Boltzmann solvers.

We further show that the Berry curvature stabilizes the chiral $p$-wave superconductivity and can induce transitions to higher-angular-momentum pairings. Our results establish that the phonon-mediated mechanism is a viable pairing candidate in single-flavor systems, such as the quarter-metal superconductivity observed in rhombohedral graphene multilayers."}

Here, we directly visualize in-gap electronic states bound to impurities inside an exciton condensate phase of a van der Waals crystal Ta2Pd3Te5, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that the energies of in-gap states are strongly correlated with the excitonic band gap, which is systematically tuned by local strain and carrier injection.

Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models."}

Unlike previous schemes relying on externally engineered potentials or pump-loss landscapes, our approach reveals that the intrinsic nonlinear hydrodynamics of polariton fluids alone can lead to horizon formation. Using Whitham modulation theory and numerical simulations, we characterize the transition between subsonic and supersonic regimes and estimate the corresponding surface gravity and Hawking temperature.

We investigate $c$-quark kinetics in a longitudinally propagating perfect fluid as well as in a viscous medium undergoing (2+1)D expansion, and find that the charm production rate decreases monotonically across all medium formulations. In the $N_f=2+1+1$ scenario, charm production is systematically suppressed due to the effective mass of heavy quasiparticles.

In particular, we demonstrate many-electron constructions with vanishing charge-2e sectors, but with sharp signatures in charge-4e or charge-6e expectation values instead. Such characterizations are consistent with previous phenomenology of vestigial order and Ginzburg-Landau theory, yet, instead of point-group-symmetry presumptions, we show that momentum conservation is both vital and sufficient. Our study thus offers a novel, general, and microscopic route to understand and characterize higher-charge superconductivity, including nontrivial experimental signatures such as fractional magnetic flux and period in interferometry, as well as localized Cooper pairs at lattice topological defects."}

Using a Monte Carlo method, we find a robust $4Q$ bipartite lattice of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs which melts through a first order phase transition at a critical temperature in certain segments of the phase diagram. The density of hedgehogs is a non-linear function of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and a linear function of the multiple-spin chiral interaction which plays the fundamental role of a ``magnetic flux'' or a hedgehog chemical potential.

These metals include zirconium, titanium, hafnium and their alloys with tendency to form hydrides. A computational method for hydrogen localization in such metals is presented. The method utilizes the heat flux in a steady state to compute temperature distribution (as input), and hydrogen mass flux under temperature gradient to determine hydrogen distribution both in solid solution and in the hydride phase in a two-dimensional setting. Hydrogen precipitation to hydride is determined by a solid solubility relation with an exponential function of the enthalpy of mixing per a van 't Hoff relation. The enthalpy of mixing is treated here as a stochastic variable subject to thermodynamic fluctuations. Henceforth, the Einstein-Boltzmann fluctuation theory is adapted to calculate the spatial distribution of hydrogen in solid solution and in the hydride phase. Hydrogen concentration gets localized in the colder region of the body (Soret effect). We apply the model to the case of a zirconium alloy, Zircaloy-4, which is a material for fuel cladding utilized in pressurized water reactors. Cladding continuously picks up hydrogen due to Zr oxidation during reactor service, which we take into account. Our calculated results, hydrogen concentration profiles are comparable to experimental observations reported in the literature."}

Here, we identify wurtzite MnX (X = S, Se, Te) as a family of multiferroic materials hosting competing AFM phases, including altermagnetic, where nonrelativistic spin splitting can be controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Using density-functional theory and atomistic spin-model calculations, we show that all pristine MnX compounds stabilize a stripe type collinear AFM ground state, contrary to earlier predictions of an altermagnetic ground state, with the magnetic order governed by frustrated Heisenberg and biquadratic exchange interactions. We further demonstrate that Cr doping drives a transition to an A-type AFM phase that breaks Kramers spin degeneracy and realizes a g-wave altermagnetic state with large nonrelativistic spin splitting near the Fermi level. Importantly, this spin splitting can be deterministically reversed by polarization switching, enabling electric-field control of altermagnetic electronic structure without reorienting the Neel vector or relying on spin-orbit coupling. The close energetic proximity of the stripe AFM to a noncollinear all-in-all-out configuration indicates that wurtzite MnX lies near a topological magnetic phase with finite scalar spin chirality, which may be stabilized by modest perturbations such as temperature, strain or chemical tuning. The distinct magnetic phases exhibit symmetry selective linear and non-linear Hall responses, providing direct transport signatures of altermagnetism and polarization control.

We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores.

Our observations are compared to recent theoretical predictions from which we can extract a dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant of $g^{2}$=0.0016 for the strong non-linear transport regime.

Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor."}

Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit.

We employ two representative physics-based bcc single crystal plasticity models taken from our previous work (Nguyen et al. 2021a; Lee et al. 2023b), each prioritizing different key deformation mechanisms. The Bayesian model calibration (BMC) is used for probabilistic estimates of material parameters in both bcc crystal plasticity models.

The sensitivity indices at various loading conditions clearly illustrate the physical basis underlying the predictive capabilities of the two distinct bcc crystal plasticity models at low to high strain rates. Both of the calibrated bcc models are then further validated beyond the calibration regime, by which we further identify critical physical mechanisms that govern the transient elastic-plastic responses of single crystal molybdenum under shock loading. The statistical inference framework demonstrated here facilitates the further development of continuum crystal plasticity models that account for a broad range of deformation mechanisms."}

When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order.

Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions."}

The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $π$ fluxes in the plaquettes. These nucleate low-energy manifolds, which can provide percolating conduction pathways for fermions to elude localization. This diffusive metal, unlike those in superconductors, can carry charge current and even anomalous Hall current. We investigate the transport properties and show that while the topological insulator to Anderson insulator transition exhibits the expected Dirac universality, the metal insulator transition displays a different critical exponent $ν\\approx 2$ compared to a disordered topological superconductor, where $ν\\approx 1.4$. Our work emphasizes the unique role of geometric disorder in engineering novel phases and their transitions in topological quantum matter."}

There are various universal predictions for the BTRS state when it is associated with a multicomponent superconducting order parameter. In particular, in the BTRS superconducting state, spontaneous fields appear around crystalline defects, impurities, superconducting domain walls and sample surfaces. However, this phenomenon has not yet been experimentally demonstrated for any BTRS superconductor. Here, we aimed to verify these predictions for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by performing muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) measurements on Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$ single crystals at ambient pressure and stoichiometric Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under hydrostatic pressure. The study allowed us to conclude that spontaneous fields in the BTRS superconducting state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ appear around non-magnetic inhomogeneities and, at the same time, decrease with the suppression of $T_{\\rm c}$. The observed behaviour is consistent with the prediction for multicomponent BTRS superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. The results of the work are relevant to understanding BTRS superconductivity in general, as they demonstrate, for the first time, the relationship among the superconducting order parameter, the BTRS transition, and crystal-structure inhomogeneities."}

In this work, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties, together with non-radiative recombination dynamics. Density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (GW) reveal that both compounds are direct band gap semiconductors with gaps spanning the infrared-visible region. Incorporating electron-hole interactions via the Bethe-Salpeter equation leads to pronounced red-shifts in the first peak of optical spectra, indicative of bound excitons with binding energies of 0.12 eV (Ca$_6$CSe$_4$) and 0.20 eV (Sr$_6$CSe$_4$), extending over nearly three unit cells in all directions. Time-dependent DFT combined with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K reveals pronounced lattice fluctuations in Ca$_6$CSe$_4$, resulting in 38% larger band gap variations and 28% faster electronic decoherence. Together with 53% weaker nonadiabatic couplings, these effects yield non-radiative recombination lifetimes approximately eleven times longer than in Sr$_6$CSe$_4$.

In contrast, for spatially separated dual spin currents, the time-reversal-invariant vector chirality emerges as a critical factor governing magnetization dynamics. Here, we investigate field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in an altermagnet RuO2/ferromagnet/heavy metal Pt trilayer, driven by chiral dual spin currents (CDSC). We demonstrate that the chirality of these dual spin currents acts as the deterministic role in breaking out-of-plane symmetry. Leveraging the intrinsic spin-splitting effect of the d-wave altermagnet to generate an x-polarized spin component, the interplay of non-collinear spin currents from two adjacent layers induces a helical magnetic texture within the intermediate layer. The resulting intralayer exchange coupling manifests as an effective in-plane magnetic field, facilitating deterministic switching. This distinct physical picture, validated by switching measurements and micromagnetic simulations, reveals that the switching polarity is dictated by chirality rather than charge current polarity. Characterized by the novel symmetry and low power consumption, CDSC offers a promising paradigm for next-generation high-performance spintronic architectures."}

As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community."}

Here we study the pairing symmetry of Weyl semimetal $T_d$-MoTe$_2$, where previous measurements of $λ$ have yielded conflicting results. We utilize a novel technique based on a microwave resontor to measure the kinetic inductance of MoTe$_2$, which is directly related to $λ$.

However, Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and second Rényi entropies varies from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the Rényi index. By constructing a number-conserving many-body state with only two local degrees of freedom, we obtain a Rényi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling: the second Rényi entropy remains logarithmic while the von Neumann entropy is parametrically larger. We then introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved second Rényi entropies and the subsystem charge distribution. Comparing this bound to the total second Rényi entropy provides a practical diagnostic for anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data."}

Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture.

By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration."}

The flavour structure of the double seesaw framework is invoked by an $A_4$ discrete symmetry which yields predictive textures for the Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$, the mixing matrix $M_{RS}$ connecting right-handed and sterile neutrinos, and the bare Majorana mass matrix $M_S$ for the sterile neutrinos. The interesting feature of the present framework is that the combination of the double seesaw mechanism and $A_4$ flavour alignments yields a leading-order TBM structure, corrected by a single rotation in the (1-3) sector. We also derive analytic expressions for the heavy sterile eigenvalues and for the resulting light neutrino masses, thereby clarifying the role of the symmetry in shaping the neutrino mass hierarchy. We further incorporate the most recent JUNO measurements, which improve the precision of the solar mixing angle $\\sin^2θ_{12} \\simeq 0.31$, along with updated constraints on $\\sin^2θ_{13}$. We show that these results significantly restrict the allowed parameter space of the model. In particular, the observed value of $\\sin^2θ_{12}$ constrains the magnitude of the (1--3) rotation and the phases associated with the $A_4$ flavon couplings, while the value of $\\sin^2θ_{13}$ sharpens these restrictions further. Overall, the interplay between double seesaw dynamics, $A_4$ flavour symmetry, and the recent JUNO constraints yields a highly predictive framework for neutrino masses and mixings, offering a coherent explanation for the generation of light neutrino masses and testable predictions for future experiments."}

This TRS breaking pairing originates from the superconducting phase frustration of different Fermi pockets and can account for experimental TRS breaking signal in kagome superconductors. Moreover, we investigate collective modes, including the Higgs, Leggett, and Bogoloubov-Anderson-Goldstone modes, arising from fluctuations of the amplitude, relative phase, and overall phase of the superconducting order parameters, respectively. Remarkably, due to the presence of multibands, one branch of the Leggett modes becomes nearly massless near the TRS breaking transition, providing a compelling smoking-gun signature of TRS-breaking superconductivity, in clear contrast to TRS-breaking charge orders.

Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states.

Under these conditions, the thickness of the oxide layer $d$ on $Cu/SiO_2$ films was found to increase over time $t$ according to a parabolic law, which is in contradiction with the predictions of existing theories of copper oxidation. A model is proposed that explains this behavior of $d(t)$ by the diffusion of atomic oxygen along the boundaries of oxide grains towards the copper film with its subsequent oxidation. The $R$ and $ρ$ of $Cu/Ge/SiO_2$ films were found to degrade much more slowly than similar characteristics of $Cu/SiO_2$ films of the same thickness. The high corrosion resistance of $Cu/Ge/SiO_2$ films is explained by the peculiarities of $Ge$ redistribution during the growth of the copper film on a germanium sublayer. The long-term retention by $Cu/Ge/SiO_2$ films of their characteristics allows them to be recommended as a cheap replacement for gold coating in electromagnetic interference protection devices."}

We show that the orbital magnetic octupole is naturally linked to a higher-rank Hall response induced by spatially nonuniform electric fields, leading to a generalized Středa-type relation. Finally, we demonstrate that such a Hall response can arise even when symmetry forbids the conventional anomalous Hall effect against uniform electric fields, thereby providing an illustrative response characteristic to altermagnets."}

In the presence of a finite number density of background particles, loop-level interactions can generate an effective force that is significantly enhanced relative to the vacuum case. We construct a two-component DM model in which the dominant component is a fermionic particle $χ$ and the subdominant component is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle $φ$. The annihilation of $χ$ proceeds through the p-wave channel and produces gamma-ray emission. The finite density of $φ$ particles induces a background-enhanced force between $χ$ particles, leading to a sizable Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation. We show that a viable region of parameter space in this model can account for the gamma-ray excess observed in the Galactic Center using Fermi-LAT data. The background-induced force substantially amplifies the Sommerfeld enhancement and thus enlarges the parameter space capable of explaining the excess, highlighting the importance of background effects in astrophysical environments."}

The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection. We point out that the phase dependence in the levels imaginary part originates from the breaking of a time-reversal-like symmetry. In particular, spectral configurations in the broken phase of the symmetry and without EPs can be obtained, where this novel contribution can be easily resolved. The proposed protocol would allow to probe for the first time a fingerprint of non-Hermiticity in open junctions that is not strictly related to the presence of EPs."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Altermagnets exhibit spin-split electronic band structures despite having zero net magnetization, making them attractive for field-free spintronic applications. In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \\neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the ratio of spin to charge conductance exhibits characteristic square-like patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization. Our results establish geometry as an effective control parameter for spin polarization in altermagnets and suggest a viable route for exploiting finite-size effects in mesoscopic altermagnetic spintronic devices."}

Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project.

The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP.

The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering. Our neutron diffraction results confirm that long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx 47$~K, primarily driven by 4d--4f Ru$^{5+}$--Dy$^{3+}$ exchange interactions, where both Dy and Ru moments start to order simultaneously.

It has been observed that a slight N deficiency will lead to impurity of alpha-Fe, and some N efficiency would result in epsilon-Fe3N phase. Through this work, it has been demonstrated that the doping of Pd can be suitably utilized to extend the Ts-Nc regime for the growth of Fe4N thin films. EXAFS analysis indicate that Pd atoms are substituting corner Fe atoms. Magnetization measurements reveal that the saturation magnetization reduces nominally with Pd doping up to 13 at.%.

In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling.

We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, ν_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation.

Pure TiO2, however, has inadequate activity towards the H2O2 activation and is often constrained by the intrinsic electronic limitations of pristine TiO2. Herein, a rational approach has been demonstrated to improve the Fenton-like catalytic performance of TiO2 through multivalent vanadium (V) doping. A comprehensive characterization using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that V incorporation substantially alters the electronic structure of TiO2. The DFT results, supported by experimental data, indicate that V doping enhances Ti-O covalence and introduces mid-gap states, resulting in a reduced band gap and improved charge transfer. XPS confirms the coexistence of multiple oxidation states of V, which serve as active centres for activating H2O2 and generating OH radicals. As a result, V-doped TiO2 exhibits significantly enhanced dark-catalytic activity in degrading the organic dye Rhodamine B (RhB). Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into multivalent-cation-induced valence state and electronic structure modulation in TiO2, offering a promising strategy for designing high-performance catalysts via defect engineering for sustainable environmental remediation."}

Molecular dynamics (MD) naturally captures ballistic transport and phonon nonequilibrium, but has not been applied to hot-spot problems due to computational cost. Here, we perform the first MD simulations of hot-spot heat transfer across ballistic-diffusive regimes and benchmark them against FEM. We find that FEM using bulk thermal conductivity $κ_0$ significantly underestimates hot-spot temperature, even when the channel thickness is ~10 times the phonon mean free path, indicating persistent non-Fourier effects. We introduce a size-dependent \"best\" conductivity, $κ_{\\mathrm{best}}$, using which FEM can reproduce MD hot-spot temperatures with high fidelity. We further decompose the MD-extracted thermal resistance into: (i) diffusive spreading, (ii) cross-plane ballistic, (iii) heat-carrier selective heating, and (iv) residual 3D ballistic-spreading resistances, and quantify each contribution. The resulting framework offers a practical route to embed non-Fourier physics into FEM for hot-spot prediction, reliability assessment, and thermally aware design of next-generation transistors."}

The extent to which tritium accumulates on surfaces is generally material-dependent and must be determined through experiments. Additionally, this surface contamination necessitates the implementation of appropriate decontamination procedures, preferably in-situ. A suitable method could be exposure to ozone during UV irradiation. However, it is currently not known if both components are necessary for the decontamination. At Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe, both questions on contamination and decontamination can be addressed using a single experimental setup. With this, it is possible to expose solid samples to gaseous tritium to measure the temporal activity evolution. Furthermore, the system can be filled with dry air, and dry air containing ozone to explore their decontamination effect. Both measurement modes were applied to beryllium and tungsten samples, which were chosen for their relevance in fusion. The beryllium surface was observed to accumulate tritium more than four times faster than tungsten when exposed to gaseous tritium. Concerning the decontamination, without simultaneous UV irradiation, exposure to ozone did not have any distinct effect on the surface activity compared to simply using dry air. This leads to the conclusion that UV illumination of the surfaces is required to achieve a significant decontamination factor."}

We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, ν_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems."}

However, the possibility of modulating quantum geometric quantities in real-time remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic modulation of Berry curvature and its moments, as well as the generation of a pseudo-electric field using time-dependent strain. By placing heterostructures on a membrane, we introduce oscillatory strain together with an in-plane AC electric field and measure Hall signals that are modulated at linear combinations of the frequencies of strain and electric field. Our measurements reveal modulation of Berry curvature and its first moment. Notably, we provide direct experimental evidence of pseudo-electric field that results in an unusual dynamic strain-induced Hall response. This approach opens up a new pathway for controlling quantum geometry on demand, moving beyond conventional static perturbations. The pseudo-electric field provides a framework for external electric field-free anomalous Hall response and opens new avenues for probing the topological properties."}

In this study, we report the sputter deposition of Al0.64Sc0.36N thin films from a 300 mm Al0.64Sc0.36 alloy target on 200 mm Si(100) wafers, achieving an exceptionally high deposition rate of 8.7 μm/h with less than 1% AOGs and controllable stress tuning.

The wafer yield and device failure rates are analysed and correlated with the average stress of the films and their stress profiles along the diameter.

The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection. We point out that the phase dependence in the levels imaginary part originates from the breaking of a time-reversal-like symmetry. In particular, spectral configurations in the broken phase of the symmetry and without EPs can be obtained, where this novel contribution can be easily resolved. The proposed protocol would allow to probe for the first time a fingerprint of non-Hermiticity in open junctions that is not strictly related to the presence of EPs."}

As a dynamical characteristic, strain rate dependence is shown to be intimately connected to dislocation avalanches, which are a fundamental mechanism of dislocation dynamics. Using carefully designed, state of the art dislocation dynamics simulations in the intermediate range strain rate from 5 to 1000, we show that increasing strain rate promotes the activation of a growing number of stronger sites. The dislocation microstructure progressively rearranges into configurations with shorter segments. Dislocation avalanches become larger through the superposition of simultaneous events and because stronger obstacles are required to arrest them. As a result, the avalanche statistics are strongly affected by strain rate, with a reduced power law regime and an increasing power law exponent. Larger avalanches, in turn, lead to an enhanced dislocation storage rate. Contribution from collinear systems to avalanches and cross slip activity decreases, altering the fraction of screw dislocations and the resulting microstructure. These results provide an original mesoscopic picture of rate sensitivity in this strain rate range and offer a mechanistic interpretation of existing observations and findings from experiments and simulations."}

The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $π$ fluxes in the plaquettes.

The physical properties can be either explicitly observed (\"apparent\") or concealed by the perceived symmetry (\"hidden\") but still exist. Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend \"hidden effects\" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects."}

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device.

In particular, in the BTRS superconducting state, spontaneous fields appear around crystalline defects, impurities, superconducting domain walls and sample surfaces. However, this phenomenon has not yet been experimentally demonstrated for any BTRS superconductor.

The observed behaviour is consistent with the prediction for multicomponent BTRS superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

Notably, when the lightest unstable dark meson has a mass of approximately $3$ GeV, it predominantly decays into a pair of gluons and behaves as a long-lived particle, a scenario that has received relatively little attention. We consider various Higgs production channels at the LHC and investigate two processes for generating dark mesons: (1) the cascade decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of light pseudoscalar mediators, which subsequently decay into four dark mesons; and (2) the dark shower and hadronization process whereby the Higgs boson decays into a pair of dark quarks that subsequently evolve into dark mesons. These processes give rise to novel gluon-rich dark jets composed of long-lived dark mesons.

Here we study the pairing symmetry of Weyl semimetal $T_d$-MoTe$_2$, where previous measurements of $λ$ have yielded conflicting results. We utilize a novel technique based on a microwave resontor to measure the kinetic inductance of MoTe$_2$, which is directly related to $λ$. The high precision of this technique allows us to observe power-law temperature dependence of $λ$, and to measure the anomalous nonlinear Meissner effect -- the current dependence of $λ$ arising from nodal quasiparticles.

However, the recognition of metallic hydrogen as the \"Holy Grail\" of high-pressure science highlights the difficulty of high-density hydrogen aggregation. Here, we report a solid-state crystal H9@C20 formed by embedding hydrogen atoms into C20 fullerene cages and utilizing chemical precompression, which remains stable under ambient pressure and temperature conditions and exhibits metallic properties. This precompression effect is reflected in the formation of C-H bonds within the cage and C-C bonds between cages, resulting in the transformation of all C atoms from sp2 to sp3 hybridization with inward and outward distortions, while promoting delocalized multicenter bonding within the H9 aggregate. In particular, the hydrogen density inside the C20 cage exceeds that of solid hydrogen, achieving a uniform discrete distribution with H9 as monomers. Further study reveals that filling hydrogen molecules into voids between H9@C20 primitive cells can increase hydrogen content while maintaining structural stability, forming a solid-gas mixed hydrogen storage crystal. Our findings provide a basis for developing high-density hydrogen storage materials under ambient conditions."}

Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of monolayer tin telluride (SnTe2) in its 1T (CdI2-type, P3m1) structure. Our calculations establish its energetic and dynamical stability, confirmed by large cohesive (10.9 eV/atom) and formation (-4.06 eV/atom) energies and a phonon spectrum free of imaginary modes. The electronic band structure reveals metallicity arising from strong Sn-Te p orbital hybridization. Most importantly, phonon dispersion analysis uncovers a microscopic origin for the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity: the heavy mass of Te atoms, weak Sn-Te bonding, and flat acoustic branches that yield exceptionally low and anisotropic group velocities (~5.0 x 10^3 m/s), together with the absence of a phonon bandgap that enhances Umklapp scattering. These features converge to suppress phonon-mediated heat transport. Complementary calculations of the optical dielectric response and joint density of states reveal pronounced interband transitions and a plasmonic resonance near 4.84 eV, suggesting additional optoelectronic opportunities. These findings establish monolayer SnTe2 as a 2D material whose vibrational softness naturally enforces ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, underscoring its potential for thermoelectric applications."}

Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\\overlineθ$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level.

These properties make electrides attractive for catalysis, transparent conductors, and emergent quantum phenomena, yet their theoretical treatment remains challenging. In conventional materials, the ground-state atomic structure dictates the electronic configuration, whereas in electrides the electronic structure can instead govern the atomic arrangement. Here, the performance of commonly used exchange-correlation functionals is evaluated for representative one-, two-, and three-dimensional electrides. The results show that higher-cost approaches do not necessarily perform better across all cases, while standard methods capture the qualitative electride character and many key energetic and structural trends with surprising reliability. This behavior, likely arising from fortuitous error cancellation, supports the reliability of legacy studies in the field and the viability of efficient high-throughput exploration using low-cost methods. Overall, the findings support a tiered computational strategy for electride modelling, integrating system-specific heuristics with efficient first-principles screening. This approach balances computational feasibility with physical fidelity and underscores the continuing leadership of theory in the predictive discovery of electride materials across dimensionalities."}

We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, ν_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems."}

We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT). We then construct all renormalizable tree-level UV completions that generate the relevant DM-SMEFT operators up to dimension-8 using a topology-based classification. Using this framework, we present minimal UV-complete models for different DM types that can yield effective neutrino-DM couplings up to several orders of magnitude larger than the Fermi coupling, while satisfying all constraints, most notably from neutrino mass and from the charged-lepton sector. This includes a pseudo-Dirac fermion DM realization in the scotogenic neutrino mass model and models of Majorana DM inspired by type-II and inverse seesaw-based neutrino mass models.

It relies on electronic states with spin valley locking, first predicted and observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. However, very few bulk materials have been reported to host spin valley locked electronic states. In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling. These findings establish a new platform for exploring coupled spin valley physics in bulk materials and highlight its potential for valleytronic device applications."}

Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator."}

However, the possibility of modulating quantum geometric quantities in real-time remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic modulation of Berry curvature and its moments, as well as the generation of a pseudo-electric field using time-dependent strain. By placing heterostructures on a membrane, we introduce oscillatory strain together with an in-plane AC electric field and measure Hall signals that are modulated at linear combinations of the frequencies of strain and electric field.

Notably, we provide direct experimental evidence of pseudo-electric field that results in an unusual dynamic strain-induced Hall response.
