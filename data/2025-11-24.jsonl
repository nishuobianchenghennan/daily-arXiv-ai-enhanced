In electronic systems, however, its counterpart has long been overlooked due to the absence of electron polarization. Here, using large-scale first-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structure of twisted bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. We find spontaneous spin polarization and the emergence of hidden flat bands at the interface between atomic layers. Most notably, we discover an unconventional geometric phase analogous to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in optics. This electronic geometric phase exerts opposite effects on superconducting currents of opposite chirality, enabling twisted cuprates to act as a filter for chiral superconducting current-even if the ground state itself is non-chiral."}

While most experimental efforts have focused on devices with N$\\leq 9$ layers, the electronic structure of thick rhombohedral graphene features flat-band surface states even in the infinite layer limit. Here, we use layer resolved capacitance measurements to directly detect these surface states for $N\\approx 13$ layer rhombohedral graphene devices. Using electronic transport and local magnetometry, we find that the surface states host a variety of ferromagnetic phases, including both valley imbalanced quarter metals and broad regimes of density in which the system spontaneously spin polarizes. We observe several superconducting states localized to a single surface state. These superconductors appear on the unpolarized side of the density-tuned spin transitions, and show strong violations of the Pauli limit consistent with a dominant attractive interaction in the spin-triplet, valley-singlet pairing channel. In contrast to previous studies of rhombohedral multilayers, however, we find that superconductivity can persist to zero displacement field where the system is inversion symmetric. Energetic considerations suggest that superconductivity in this regime is described by the existence of two independent surface superconductors coupled via tunneling through the insulating single crystal graphite bulk."}

Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \\emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions.

We ask whether axiomatic no-arbitrage laws, imposed as soft penalties on a learned world model, can reliably align high-capacity RL agents, or mainly create Goodhart-style incentives to exploit model errors. From classical static no-arbitrage conditions we build a finite-dimensional convex volatility law manifold of admissible total-variance surfaces, together with a metric law-penalty functional and a Graceful Failure Index (GFI) that normalizes law degradation under shocks. A synthetic generator produces law-consistent trajectories, while a recurrent neural world model trained without law regularization exhibits structured off-manifold errors. On this testbed we define a Goodhart decomposition \\(r = r^{\\mathcal{M}} + r^\\perp\\), where \\(r^\\perp\\) is ghost arbitrage from off-manifold prediction error. We prove a ghost-arbitrage incentive theorem for PPO-type agents, a law-strength trade-off theorem showing that stronger penalties eventually worsen P\\&L, and a no-free-lunch theorem: under a law-consistent world model and law-aligned strategy class, unconstrained law-seeking RL cannot Pareto-dominate structural baselines on P\\&L, penalties, and GFI. In experiments on an SPX/VIX-like world model, simple structural strategies form the empirical law-strength frontier, while all law-seeking RL variants underperform and move into high-penalty, high-GFI regions.

At the integrated, cumulative level, they naturally define $n$ jet rates, providing a jet-multiplicity-based characterisation of multi-jet final states.

They are thus usable as resolution variables in the context of higher-order calculations via phase-space slicing, matching fixed-order calculations to parton showers, and testing the logarithmic accuracy of shower algorithms. From a theoretical viewpoint, such observables feature a simple all-order structure and are free of non-global logarithmic corrections.

To solve this limitation, we propose the use of micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation to study the magnetocaloric effect of a ferromagnetic material around its Curie transition. Following our proposed methodology, we obtain reliable isothermal entropy change curves for both monocrystalline and polycrystalline configurations, where we consider different anisotropic contributions. The robustness of the method was evaluated, yielding results that agreed with previous experimental and theoretical observations. Our study shows that micromagnetic simulations are a powerful tool for analyzing magnetocaloric materials with complex microstructures."}

Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter. Remarkably, we find an \"ALP miracle\": a Planck-suppressed quadratic coupling yields an ALP abundance comparable to the observed dark matter density, largely independent of its initial displacement and mass."}

Here, we demonstrate a W doping-induced phase transition from non-centrosymmetric AA stacking to centrosymmetric AB' in 2L MoS2 synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Using polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, we identify a phase transition correlated with increasing tungsten (W) concentration. The dilute W-doped 2L system exhibits a vanishing SHG signal and a stiffening of the layer-breathing (LB) vibrational mode, in contrast to undoped samples with strong SHG and a softer LB mode. Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) demonstrates the spatial distribution of W concentration and associated structural changes. These findings highlight W-doping as an effective strategy for inducing phase transitions in 2L TMDs, opening new possibilities for engineered heterostructures, phase-controlled device applications or as a source of single photon emitters."}

We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz.

Cesium tin iodide is one such, with a direct bandgap and near-infrared emission, though its performance is limited by instability. We show that phthalimide (PTM) passivation during single crystal growth enhances optical output and ambient stability. Under continuous excitation, PTM-passivated microscale crystals show up to a nearly one order of magnitude increase in photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, accompanied by reversible sharpening of a low-frequency Raman mode associated with Cs rattling. This reveals dynamic, light-induced lattice reordering that passivates trap states and enhances radiative recombination. Mechanical grinding yields nanocrystals with redshifted, narrowed PL, consistent with a relaxed polymorph and reduced inhomogeneous broadening. Despite increased surface area, PTM remains effective in preserving near-infrared emission in nanocrystals as well. Power-dependent PL reveals distinct carrier dynamics, where microcrystals show redshift due to bandgap renormalization, while nanocrystals show blueshift and elevated carrier temperatures (300 to 1900 K), consistent with hot-carrier recombination. Extended illumination reveals reversible optical changes, including PL modulation, reflecting dynamic light-matter interactions and evolving defect landscapes.

In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes."}

We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy.

Here, a formulation derived from Dynamic Present Theory (DP$Φ$) and its Continuous Present Actualization (CPA) framework is tested: a CPA Rate modulated by a temperature-dependent Constraint Load $C(T)$, the CPA + Constraint (CPA + C) model. This formulation was evaluated across three canonical datasets: ortho-terphenyl (OTP) measurements from Laughlin and Uhlmann (1972) and Plazek et al. (1994), and glycerol-water mixtures from Kumar et al. (1994). Across all evaluated systems, the CPA + C formulation demonstrated statistical parity with the VFT model ($R^{2} > 0.99$), reproducing the viscosity curve by more than 14 orders of magnitude. Unlike the VFT equation, this approach derives the nonlinear curvature from a physically interpretable mechanism: the increase in configurational constraint as the system approaches a CPA Lock-In threshold. These findings indicate that the residual noise observed in simpler models represents an actual physical signal, which the CPA + C model effectively isolates. This suggests that the VFT's empirical success originates from its implicit capture of an underlying constraint-driven dynamic, providing a physically interpretable foundation for one of the most enduring phenomenological equations in materials science."}

Quantum and neuromorphic computing rely on unconventional materials and device functionalities, yet achieving resilience to imperfections and reliable operation remains a major challenge. This has motivated growing interest in topological materials that provide robust and low-power operation while preserving coherence. However, integrating coherent topological transport with non-volatile memory functionality in a single reconfigurable device has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime. The intrinsic floating-gate behavior allows one to reconfigure the transistor functionality into memristive functionality with broad electric-field tunability. Unlike other memristor implementations, one resistance state is governed entirely by dissipationless, coherent transport through helical edge channels, while the other arises from incoherent bulk conduction. By combining electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, our device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element that integrates coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures."}

Here, an automated nanoindentation (AE-NI) framework is developed and validated for adaptive mechanical mapping of combinatorial thin-film libraries. The method integrates heteroskedastic Gaussian-process modeling with cost-aware Bayesian optimization to dynamically select indentation locations and hold times, minimizing total testing time while preserving measurement accuracy. A detailed emulator and cost model capture the intrinsic penalties associated with lateral motion, drift stabilization, and reconfiguration-factors often neglected in conventional active-learning approaches. To prevent kernel-length-scale collapse caused by disparate time scales, a hierarchical meta-testing workflow combining local grid and global exploration is introduced.

In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior.

To achieve this, HOPG samples were irradiated with protons 1-3 MeV and carbon ions 600 keV - 2 MeV. A significant change in the magnetic moment was observed with respect to the irradiation energy for both ion species. The effect of energy variation was analyzed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and SRIM simulations. The results demonstrate that ion-beam-induced magnetic ordering strongly depends on both the ion species and the beam energy. Magnetic measurements were performed with varying irradiation energies, showing that carbon ion irradiation produces a higher degree of magnetic ordering compared to proton irradiation at the same dose. The maximum magnetization was obtained at 1.2 MeV carbon ion irradiation. SRIM simulations confirm that carbon ions create a greater number of lattice defects than proton ions, which correlates with the enhanced magnetic response."}

We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains.

Here, we present conductance measurements of a quantum point contact (QPC) in bilayer graphene (BLG). Beyond the expected quantized conductance plateaus, which reflect spin and valley degeneracy, we observe an additional subband, known as `0.7 anomaly' exhibiting signatures of Kondo physics and a $T_\\mathrm{K}$ ranging from approximately 0.5 up to 2.4 K at zero magnetic field, corresponding to Kondo energies between 40 and 200 $μ$eV.

Leveraging the CSOT, we achieve nearly 100% field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in a 6 nm CoPt layer at room temperature. Simultaneously, the CIHE observed in this material exhibits nearly identical dependencies on both current angle and growth temperature as the CSOT. Symmetry analysis confirms that both effects share a common physical origin. Our work not only establishes CoPt as a high-performance spin-orbit material, but also demonstrates that unconventional spin transport can be realized in high-symmetry systems, thereby opening a broad pathway for their application in practical spintronics."}

Previous theoretical work has shown that the threshold behavior in linear response spectroscopy can reveal the fractional exchange statistics between an anyon and its antiparticle. In this work, we extend this framework to nonlinear, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations that are consistent with the correct fractional exchange statistics for both the Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons."}

We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains.

Taking monolayer multiferroics $\\mbox{Ti}_{2}\\mbox{F}_{3}$ as an example, our calculations demonstrate that ferroelectric switching can significantly modulate spin exchanges, thereby enabling nonvolatile and reversible electric control of the magnons.

Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains.

Analysis of these data identifies three possible mechanisms responsible for the enhanced Berry curvature driving the observed topological Hall effect. Below and above $T_{\\rm N}$, Weyl states are the main sources of large momentum-space Berry curvature, though their formation mechanisms differ in these two temperature ranges. Below $T_{\\rm N}$, breaking of $C_{3}$ symmetry generates Dirac points that split into Weyl nodes in applied magnetic field, whereas above $T_{\\rm N}$, strong spin fluctuations can induce Weyl states. The third contribution, which occurs below $T_{\\rm N}$, arises from scalar spin chirality developing within antiferromagnetic domain walls, which generates a real-space Berry curvature."}

Typical MLIP usage guidelines emphasize the need for exhaustive training sets and warn against applying the models to situations not considered in the corresponding training space. This restricts the scope of MLIPs to interpolative calculations, essentially denying the possibility of using them to discover new phenomena in a serendipitous way. While there are reasons to be cautious, here we adopt a more sanguine view and challenge the predictive power of two representative and widely available MLIP approaches. We work with minimalist training sets that rely on little prior knowledge of the investigated materials. We show that the resulting models -- for which we adopt modest/default choices of the defining hyperparameters -- are very successful in predicting non-trivial structural effects (competing polymorphs, energy barriers for structural transformations, occurrence of non-trivial topologies) in a way that is qualitatively and quasi-quantitatively correct. Our results thus suggest an expanded scope of modern MLIP approaches, evidencing that somewhat trivial -- and easy to compute -- models can be an effective tool for the discovery of novel and complex physical phenomena."}

The crystal structure features an equilateral triangular lattice of Fe$^{3+}$ ions. The thermodynamic measurements reveal the onset of a magnetic long-range order at $T_{\\rm N1} \\simeq 7.8$ K in zero-field, followed by another low temperature field induced ordering at $T_{\\rm N2}$ in higher fields. The transition at $T_{\\rm N1}$ is further confirmed from the NMR spin lattice relaxation measurements. The value of the frustration ratio ($f \\simeq 7$) implies moderate spin frustration in the compound. The $^{31}$P NMR spectra exhibit two distinct spectral lines corresponding to two inequivalent phosphorus sites (P1 and P2), consistent with the crystal structure. The P1 site is strongly coupled with an isotropic hyperfine coupling of $A_{\\rm hf}^{\\rm iso} = 0.55(2)$ T/$μ_{\\rm B}$ while the P2 site is weakly coupled with $A_{\\rm hf}^{\\rm iso} = 0.25(3)$ T/$μ_{\\rm B}$ with the Fe$^{3+}$ ions. The magnetic susceptibility and NMR shift data are described well assuming a spin-$5/2$ isotropic triangular lattice antiferromagnetic model with an average exchange coupling of $J/k_{\\rm B} = 2.8(2)$ K. Below $T_{\\rm N1}$, the spectra evolve into a nearly rectangular powder pattern, indicating a commensurate antiferromagnetic type order. The $^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate well below $T_{\\rm N1}$ follows a $T^3$ temperature dependence, implying a two-magnon Raman scattering mechanism in the ordered state. Three well-defined phase regimes are clearly ascertained in the $H-T$ phase diagram, reflecting a weak magnetic anisotropy in the compound."}

In this picture, the photon-drag shift current corresponds to the dipole moment of the geometric loop, while the photon-drag injection current arises from the same loop weighted by a band velocity difference. We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy. Remarkably, an in-plane wavevector only a few times larger than that of free-space photons already produces sizable photon-drag currents in centrosymmetric TBG, comparable to photogalvanic responses in typical noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional materials. These currents are broadly tunable by twist angle, photon wavevector, and light polarization. Our results establish a quantum geometric framework for nonlinear photon-drag phenomena and highlight moiré bilayers as promising platforms for large, highly tunable optoelectronic responses."}

Here, we demonstrate ReS$_2$-hBN FETs with few-layer graphene (FLG) van der Waals contacts that form nearly barrier-free interfaces, enabling intrinsic transport in ReS$_2$, an anisotropic, low-symmetry TMDC rarely exhibiting disorder-free behavior. The clean ReS$_2$-FLG platform allows direct observation of random telegraph noise (RTN) even in micron-scale channels, manifested as discrete two-level current fluctuations between 90-150 K arising from stochastic trapping at localized hBN defect sites. With increasing temperature, the RTN evolves into a 1/f spectrum as multiple traps activate. Statistical analysis of RTN amplitudes and capture-emission kinetics identifies substitutional carbon-related centers in hBN as dominant defects. These findings establish a generalizable approach for probing dielectric-origin defect dynamics in intrinsically conducting, low-symmetry 2D semiconductors."}

While unconventional spin transport phenomena have been predominantly explored in low-symmetry systems (e.g., $C_{1v}$ symmetry), high-symmetry crystals--which constitute the majority of industry-compatible materials--are generally expected to exhibit only conventional spin-transport behavior. Here, we report the coexistence of two unconventional spin transport effects, the crystal spin-orbit torque (CSOT) and the crystal in-plane Hall effect (CIHE), in a CoPt single ferromagnetic layer with $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Leveraging the CSOT, we achieve nearly 100% field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in a 6 nm CoPt layer at room temperature. Simultaneously, the CIHE observed in this material exhibits nearly identical dependencies on both current angle and growth temperature as the CSOT. Symmetry analysis confirms that both effects share a common physical origin. Our work not only establishes CoPt as a high-performance spin-orbit material, but also demonstrates that unconventional spin transport can be realized in high-symmetry systems, thereby opening a broad pathway for their application in practical spintronics."}
