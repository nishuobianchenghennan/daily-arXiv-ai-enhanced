We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $α$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $α=3$, changing from a topological $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($α<3$) to a columnar ordered state ($α>3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $ξ\\propto1/|α-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class."}

In particular, we prove that the topological stability of interface modes is invariant under flux attachment. We compare next-generation paired states to Bonderson-Slingerland states at the same filling factors, and demonstrate that their quasiparticles carry identical charges and obey the same exchange statistics. The next-generation and Bonderson-Slingerland states still describe distinct phases, and we find that the former are energetically favored in the lowest Landau level, while the latter are favored in the first excited level."}

We investigate elastic constants in EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$, a quasi-two-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnet, by measuring sound velocity in magnetic fields perpendicular to spontaneous magnetization. The shear modulus $C_{44}$ exhibits dramatic softening at the field-induced transition from the ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase with magnetic moments forced to polarize along the applied transverse field. The softening is attributed to strong magnetic fluctuations near a second-order phase transition.

For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement."}

These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity. Using a combination of density-functional theory and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we compute from first principles the variations of $m_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ induced solely by apical oxygen displacement in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+δ}$, Bi-2212, and HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$.

The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences."}

Notably, none of the characteristic energy scales apparent in the spectral gap show appreciable spatial variations, suggesting that the finite-momentum pairing is negligible. Instead, the spectral weight near the coherence peak is modulated with the same periodicity as the CDW. The maximum position of the coherence-peak-weight modulation coincides with neither the peak nor the bottom of the CDW modulation; rather, it aligns with the center of one of the two inequivalent triangular plaquettes that comprise the CDW unit cell.

Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path.

Mesoscale hydrocodes resolve these processes but are computationally expensive, limiting their use in parametric studies and uncertainty quantification. In this work, we develop a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network as a spatiotemporal surrogate for mesoscale simulations of weak shock propagation in granular media. Using two-dimensional hydrocode simulations as training data, we first consider a simplified \"billiard break\" problem in which a cue ball impacts a cluster of nine circular balls, all deformable. Sequences of pressure-field images serve as input-output pairs for a sequence-to-sequence ConvLSTM, which is trained to predict future frames from a short history. We compare several architectures and show that a relatively compact encoder-decoder ConvLSTM accurately reproduces the propagation of the pressure wave and the resulting particle motion for an unseen combination of cue-ball position and impact velocity. As a proof-of-concept extension, we apply the same ConvLSTM framework to previously published mesoscale simulations of weak shock compaction in a granular ensemble. When evaluated at piston impact speeds that were completely withheld from training, the surrogate captures the position and shape of the compaction front and its dependence on impact speed, while smoothing fine pore-scale details in the highly compacted region as expected. These results demonstrate that ConvLSTM models can serve as satisfactory surrogates for spatiotemporal mesoscale simulations of granular wave propagation, enabling accelerated exploration of parameter space and laying the groundwork for physics-informed, mesoscale simulations of granular materials under shock loading."}

Temperature and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties were compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. We found that the effect of electronic excitations is negligible for all the thermodynamic properties. LDA+SOC provides a better agreement with the experimental volume, while the thermal expansion coefficients from LDA+SOC and PBEsol + SOC closely match experimental values. SOC effects appear insignificant for the isobaric heat capacity but substantially contribute to the adiabatic bulk modulus. The phonon dispersions and mode-Grüneisen parameters (γ_qη) were interpolated at the lattice constant corresponding to 301 K. The SR dispersions exhibit several anomalies in all directions, which were suppressed significantly by the inclusion of SOC. The role of SOC on the elastic constant-coefficient (C_ij) and elastic anisotropy factor at 0 K is also studied. The Pugh ratio confirmed that simple cubic polonium is ductile, and we observed that the elastic anisotropy factor and Pugh ratio decreased with increasing pressure. The effect of SOC on the Cauchy pressure is also determined."}

Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture."}

B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $π$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable.

Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $γ$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $ΔG_{\\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability."}

However, the quantitative effects of solute distribution on defect mobility remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically investigate how Al and Ca solutes affect the motion of dislocations, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) in Mg. Within the idealized framework of random solid-solution, solute drag is dominated by elastic interactions arising from atomic size mismatch, resulting in a stronger resistance from Ca than from Al. In contrast, under the more realistic condition where solute segregation occurs, the dominant mechanism shifts to chemically driven pinning, whose effectiveness is governed by the attainable segregation density. Owing to strong Ca-Ca repulsion, Al achieves substantially higher segregation concentrations than Ca and therefore exerts much stronger pinning effects. Notably, solute-induced retardation is significantly more pronounced for HAGBs than for LAGBs, leading to amplified solute effects during the late stages of recrystallization, where grain growth is controlled primarily by HAGB migration. These results provide atomic-scale insight into experimentally observed grain refinement in Mg alloys."}

Here we show that in individual carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated from highly conductive solution-spun fibers, different probes, including the field scales and magnitudes of WL and UCF and nonlocal magnetoconductance, lead to strikingly disparate estimates of coherence lengths. WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle. These findings challenge the conventional single-scale picture of mesoscopic coherence and establish carbon nanotube bundles as a model platform for emergent, network-level quantum transport."}

Focusing on cascade decay topologies, we investigate the collider signatures of the neutral scalars through the process $pp \\rightarrow SV$, where $S$ is a neutral scalar and $V$ is a vector boson. We perform a cross-section analysis across multiple benchmark points that satisfy both theoretical and experimental constraints, considering two mass hierarchy scenarios: (i) Regular Hierarchy, where the SM-like Higgs is the lightest CP-even scalar, and (ii) Medial Hierarchy, featuring one Higgs boson lighter than the SM Higgs and one heavier.

However, the performance of SNSPDs is limited not by the intrinsic properties of the superconducting film, but by edge-induced current crowding. Despite extensive materials optimization and increasingly demanding fabrication strategies aimed at mitigating this edge-limited behavior, the device edges continue to limit the maximum device operating current, thereby degrading key performance metrics. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from an edge-limited to a bulk-limited regime, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting \"rails\" placed on either side of the detector to suppress current crowding at the edges. We show that activation of the rails reduces the dark count rate by nine orders of magnitude and extends the photon detection plateau at 1550 nm by more than 40%. These results are demonstrated on detectors up to 0.1 mm wide, establishing an entirely new class of ultra-wide strip detectors that we call superconducting strip photon detectors (SSPD). Moreover, the ability to suppress edge current crowding using the rails provides a pathway toward SSPDs with strip widths extending into the mm-scale. Such devices will enable large-area, high efficiency SSPD arrays with infrared sensitivity and open new opportunities in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to deep space optical communication."}

However, the fundamental driving force for GB migration and its link with Cr depletion remains unclear. In this work, hybrid molecular dynamics and semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were employed to investigate GB migration in Alloy 690 under coupled solute diffusion and segregation effects across a range of GB characters. The results show that Cr segregation at GBs, while generally considered favorable for GB stability, can facilitate diffusion-induced GB migration and Cr depletion. Cr diffusion along GBs produces localized Cr depletion zones that are energetically incompatible with positively segregating GBs, generating a chemical driving force that drives GB migration toward the Cr-rich matrix, which ultimately results in persistent GB migration accompanied by a Cr depletion. By quantifying solute-GB interaction energetics, we demonstrate that GB migration is quantitively controlled by the coupled effects of solute diffusivity and segregation strength. These mechanistic insights provide a unified framework that rationalizes experimentally observed correlations between GB character, Cr depletion, and GB migration in Cr-containing alloys."}

Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons.

Notably, none of the characteristic energy scales apparent in the spectral gap show appreciable spatial variations, suggesting that the finite-momentum pairing is negligible. Instead, the spectral weight near the coherence peak is modulated with the same periodicity as the CDW. The maximum position of the coherence-peak-weight modulation coincides with neither the peak nor the bottom of the CDW modulation; rather, it aligns with the center of one of the two inequivalent triangular plaquettes that comprise the CDW unit cell. This distribution pattern of Bogoliubov quasiparticles directly results from the broken in-plane inversion symmetry at the surface of 2H-NbSe2, which may activate Ising spin-orbit coupling."}

At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts.

The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction."}

These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity. Using a combination of density-functional theory and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we compute from first principles the variations of $m_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ induced solely by apical oxygen displacement in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+δ}$, Bi-2212, and HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$.

We study structural variations, edge-vs-center, in these crystals using micro-X-ray diffraction and find that the enhanced emission at the edges correlates with lattice compression compared to in the central areas. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show much longer-lived photogenerated carriers at the compressed edges, with radiative component lifetimes of ca. 1.4 us, 10 times longer than at the central regions. The properties of the edges are exploited to fabricate planar photodetectors exhibiting detectivities of 3x10^13 Jones, compared to 5x10^12 Jones at the central regions.

In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), nanopillars are widely used to induce localized emission, yet the underlying confinement mechanism and the relative roles of strain versus dielectric environment remain unclear. The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone. More broadly, this combined optical-mechanical characterization approach provides a general framework for mapping structure-property relationships in 2D quantum materials at the single-emitter level."}

These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode.

Even though the non-invertible symmetry is dynamically broken at one-loop level, its violation does not affect our scenario. In this paper, we especially consider the lightest mode of the neutral components in the doublet vector-like fermions as our main dark matter candidate. The dark matter is potentially degenerated to the other two families of neutral fermions, since the mass difference is induced at one-loop level.

Considering all the constraints of neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$ and the relic density of dark matter, we perform the numerical analysis and show some allowed regions for these phenomenology.

Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA)."}

It naturally realizes the secluded dark matter scenario and can be further tested in the next generation of experiments."}

In this study, Ag+C60 and Au+C60 nanocomposite thin films were briefly investigated to elucidate the effects of ion irradiation on both their morphology and electrical properties. The films were synthesized by co-deposition of noble metals and fullerenes, using ion beam sputtering of metal targets combined with simultaneous thermal evaporation of C60. The as - deposited films were characterized by ion beam analysis to determine their composition and element depth distributions. Subsequently, the samples were irradiated at room temperature with either a continuous Ar ion beam or a pulsed C ion beam, both at an energy of 20 keV and a fluence of 1 x 1015 ions/cm2. Irradiation-induced morphological changes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. While the C-irradiated films retained compact and homogeneous surface morphologies, Ar irradiation induced pronounced surface restructuring, resulting in highly corrugated and porous-like surfaces. In addition to morphology, the electrical resistance of the films was measured. The results indicate that C-irradiated samples exhibit only minor changes in resistivity, whereas Ar irradiation strongly affects the electrical properties, with the most significant impact observed for the Au+C60 system. The observed changes in electrical resistance closely correlate with the irradiation-induced surface morphology. The measurement results are briefly discussed below."}

Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime.

We find that thermal fluctuations can strongly break spherical symmetry at early times, allowing even an isolated bubble to emit GWs. In multi-bubble simulations, thermal fluctuations systematically reshape the spectrum, suppressing the infrared part while enhancing and broadening the high-$k$ tail. We further provide an analytical estimate for the ultraviolet regime of the GW spectrum, which is in good agreement with our lattice results and suggests that this regime is dominated by thermal fluctuations.

Such an extension generally predicts $ρ\\neq1$, where $ρ$ is the electroweak rho parameter at the tree level, so that the renormalization of the electroweak parameters is different from models like the standard model (SM) and two Higgs doublet models. In this paper, we present a full set of radiative corrections to decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) in this model. One-loop contributions of the extra Higgs bosons as well as SM fermions and gauge bosons to the decay rates of $h$ are calculated in the on-shell scheme. Gauge dependence appearing in the counter terms of mixing angles is eliminated by the pinch technique. Higher-order QCD corrections are also implemented. We find that the decay rates can significantly deviate from the predictions in the SM and other extensions such as the two Higgs doublet models and the singlet model. For example, the decay rates of $h\\to WW^\\ast$ and $h\\to ZZ^\\ast$ can be a few percent larger than the SM value under current experimental and theoretical constraints.

These devices demonstrate high level of pair pulse facilitation (PPF), short term to long term memory (STM-to-LTM) transition as well as learning-forgetting-relearning properties. Effect of light intensity, pulse number, pulse width and photon energy on the STM-to-LTM transition is studied.

Electrical and optical energy consumptions per synaptic event are estimated to be as low as 280 fJ and 20 nJ, respectively. Furthermore, photocurrent in these devices is observed to increase linearly with the number of the excitation pulses. This property has been exploited to demonstrate different arithmetic operations by the device. Moreover, these devices show great potential for image recognition. Artificial neural network simulation has returned an image recognition accuracy of ~85%.

Unlike ordinary cases, such AFIs host a hidden dipole coupled to the antiferromagnetic order, which allows an external electric field to break the magnon sublattice symmetry and thereby largely lift the band degeneracy. Through group theory analysis, we identify the possible magnetic layer groups that support electric-field-induced magnon band splitting.

Among these, biexcitons -- bound states of two electrons and two holes -- provide a sensitive probe of Coulomb correlations, exciton-exciton interactions, and the role of the dielectric environment. In Ruddlesden-Popper metal halide materials (RPMHs), strong quantum and dielectric confinement stabilize excitons with binding energies of hundreds of meV, creating an ideal platform for multi-exciton phenomena. Conventional linear spectroscopies, such as photoluminescence and transient absorption, reveal biexciton signatures but suffer from spectral congestion and reabsorption artifacts. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopies, particularly two-quantum (2Q) multidimensional techniques, uniquely access multi-exciton coherences and provide unambiguous estimates of biexciton binding energies. This minireview surveys the spectroscopic evidence for biexcitons in RPMHs, highlights the advantages of nonlinear multidimensional approaches, and situates biexciton physics within the broader context of excitonic materials, including GaAs quantum wells, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides. By emphasizing the interplay of exciton-exciton annihilation, excitation-induced dephasing, and biexciton formation, we argue that multidimensional coherent spectroscopy offers the most reliable pathway to disentangle many-body interactions in quantum-well derivatives of metal-halide perovskites."}

Among magnetoelectric materials, \\FNO has attracted special attention because of its pronounced dielectric signal at high magnetic transition temperatures. However, the magnetic ground state, which is essential information for understanding its unusual magnetoelectricity, remains unclarified. Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K. This study provides insights into the understanding of its magnetoelectric properties."}

Here we focus on the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ family (M =d-electron metal), which provides a unique platform of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across 3d, 4d, and 5d systems. Using hydrostatic pressure as an additional tuning parameter, muon-spin rotation ($μ$SR) and AC susceptibility measurements uncover strongly contrasting pressure responses of superconductivity across the Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ series. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{\\rm C}$ decreases under pressure in the 3d Fe-based compound but increases for the 4d Ru- and 5d Ir-based systems, with the Ru compound showing the largest enhancement of nearly 50% within 2 GPa. The superfluid density exhibits similarly distinct pressure dependences, remaining nearly pressure independent for Fe while decreasing with increasing pressure for Ru and Ir. This suggests fundamentally different correlations between $T_{\\rm C}$ and the superfluid density. Together, these results indicate that superconductivity emerging from strongly correlated and spin-orbit-dominated regimes in Sc$_{6}$MTe$_{2}$ is likely governed by different microscopic mechanisms and offer a useful experimental basis for future microscopic theoretical studies."}

Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \\times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations."}

For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement."}

Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy on epitaxial Ba(Fe$_{0.94}Co$_{0.06})$_2$As$_2$ films, we discover an incommensurate charge-stripe order aligned with the Fe-Fe bond direction and nucleated inside magnetic vortices. These charge modulations intensify at the vortex core, extend far into the vortex halo, and persist within the superconducting gap. Strikingly, the charge order modulates Andreev bound states of vortices at non-zero energies, producing abelian vortices with half-odd-integer level quantization and non-abelian vortices with integer-quantized core states that host a Majorana zero mode. The distinct vortex types are distinguished by the registry of their centers relative to the charge-stripe pattern and remain robust in ultrathin (2.5-unit-cell) films. Our findings reveal a density-wave-textured vortex matter and provide fresh insights into the intertwined phenomena of charge-stripe order, pair-density-wave modulations, and Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors."}

However, such behaviors remain poorly understood in iron-based superconductors that have been recently recognized to harbor rich nontrivial topology. Here, we combine angle-resolved magneto-transport measurements with first principles calculations to reveal the emergence and tunability of topological semimetals in ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{2+δ}As$_2$ epitaxial films, modulated by interstitial Fe. These states exhibit ultralow residual resistivity, coexisting high-mobility electron and hole carriers, and linear positive magnetoresistance below 110 K. Remarkably, the magnetoresistance becomes more pronounced when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the film plane, reaching an unsaturated 1206% at 56 T. Furthermore, superconductivity persists in these ferropnictide films, establishing them as a tunable platform for investigating the interplay among electron correlation, topology, and superconductivity."}

In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices."}
