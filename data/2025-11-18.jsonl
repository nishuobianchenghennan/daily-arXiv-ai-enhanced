Xie", "Zhong-Yi Lu"], "title": "Probing universal imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics with infinite projected entangled pair states", "comment": "8 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "We investigate the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) with the full-update strategy. Simulating directly in the thermodynamic limit, we explore the relaxation process near the critical point with two types of initial states: a fully polarized state and a product state with a small magnetization. For the fully polarized state, the magnetization shows a power law scaling $M\\propto τ^{-β/(νz)}$ in the imaginary-time evolution, from which both the critical point and critical exponent can be determined with high accuracy. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation process exhibits a behavior of $M\\propto τ^θ$ with $θ=0.1958$ being the critical initial-slip exponent, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamic scaling of the self-correlation in quantum Monte Carlo method. These universal features emerge well before the system converges to the ground state, demonstrating the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate that iPEPS can serve as a robust and scalable method for studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems."}

In this paper we provide comprehensive mathematical and phenomenological evidence that deepens and refines this primary model. The symmetry of the 24-cell yields a unified hypercharge functional that reproduces Standard Model hypercharge assignments while ensuring anomaly cancellation. By projecting the vertices of the 24-cell onto a three-dimensional flavor subspace using a Minimal Distortion Principle, an emergent tetrahedral structure appears that gives rise to an effective $A_4$ symmetry in the neutrino sector. Extending this discrete symmetry to its binary double cover $T^\\prime$ provides the spinorial representations and intrinsic complex phases needed to generate realistic quark Yukawa textures. Guided by the tenet that spacetime and matter are inextricably linked, our analysis suggests that the intricate flavor mixing of the Standard Model may be a residual imprint of the underlying quantum-geometric nature of spacetime."}

In this work, we examine the transport properties of two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in single- and multi-channel AlScN/GaN heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy, and demonstrate the lowest sheet resistance among AlScN-based systems reported to date. Assorted schemes of GaN/AlN interlayers are first introduced in single-channel structures between AlScN and GaN to improve conductivity, increasing electron mobility up to $1370$ cm$^{2}$/V$\\cdot$s at 300 K and $4160$ cm$^{2}$/V$\\cdot$s at 77 K, reducing the sheet resistance down to 170 $Ω/\\square$ and 70 $Ω/\\square$ respectively. These improvements are then leveraged in multi-channel heterostructures, reaching sheet resistances of 65 $Ω/\\square$ for three channels and 45 $Ω/\\square$ for five channels at 300 K, further reduced to 21 $Ω/\\square$ and 13 $Ω/\\square$ at 2 K, respectively, confirming the presence of multiple 2DEGs. Structural characterization indicates pseudomorphic growth with smooth surfaces, while partial barrier relaxation and surface roughening are observed at high scandium content, with no impact on mobility. This first demonstration of ultra-low sheet resistance multi-channel AlScN/GaN heterostructures places AlScN on par with state-of-the-art multi-channel Al(In)N/GaN systems, showcasing its capacity to advance existing and enable new high-speed, high-power electronic devices."}

The normal-state reflectance of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ is analyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with one Drude component. The temperature dependences of the plasma frequency, optical conductivity, scattering rate, and dc resistivity of the Drude contribution in the normal state are presented. In the superconducting state, we observe a signature of the superconducting gap opening at $2Δ$(5~K) = 11.8~meV.

However, recent findings reveal that in certain refractory complex concentrated alloys, edge dislocations can instead control strength. This work integrates high-temperature mechanical testing, in-situ neutron scattering during heating and tension, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the mechanism behind this behavior. In the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system, increasing the V content, due to its smaller atomic size, induces substantial atomic misfit that raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures."}

The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry significantly influences this positive feedback and strongly modifies the overall current-voltage response. These results provide a framework for optimizing PGM-based devices employing GMR/GNR architectures, including voltage-controlled fast switches, incandescent emitters, and terahertz bolometric detectors."}

Multicomponent superconductors, particularly ones breaking multiple symmetries, are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. Here we show that even, nominally $single$-component superconductors under certain conditions are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. We consider nearest-neighbor pairing interactions on a square lattice that leads to $s$-wave and $d$-wave representations of link superconducting order parameter. We show that even if the subdominant order parameter is completely suppressed in the ground state, it results in multiple correlation lengths with nontrivial hierarchy, resulting in important physical consequences in inhomogeneous solutions. Under certain conditions, this leads to type-1.5 superconductivity, where magnetic field penetration length falls between two coherence lengths, leading to vortex clustering in an external magnetic field."}
