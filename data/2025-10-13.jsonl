For this purpose, the orbital character of\nthe electronic response was revealed by decomposition of the elastoresistance\ninto the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels.

Experiments were\ncarried out in a range of initial ion concentrations (1-100 mM), porous media\nparticle sizes (63 um and 500 um), and varying mixture ratios of metal ion\nconcentrations. For single-ion magnetophoresis, paramagnetic MnCl2 migrated\ntoward the magnet surface, with an enrichment of approximately 2-4 percent near\nregions of high magnetic field. Conversely, diamagnetic ZnCl2 moved away from\nregions of highest magnetic field gradients, with depletion levels of 0.5-1.8\npercent relative to the initial concentration. Our results demonstrate that\nmagnetophoresis is directly proportional to porous media particle size,\nincreasing with larger particle sizes, a trend attributed to the reduced drag\nforces experienced by the ions in media with larger particles. Interestingly,\nin binary mixtures, both MnCl2 and ZnCl2 migrated toward regions of highest\nmagnetic field, contrary to their individual behaviors. The magnetophoretic\neffect of MnCl2 was diminished with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2,\nindicating interactions between the two ions. These findings suggest that both\nmetal ions undergo field-induced cluster formation, with cluster sizes in the\nmicrometer range, in both single and binary ion systems. In binary mixtures,\nthe two ions appear to interact, potentially forming mixed clusters containing\nboth MnCl2 and ZnCl2."}
