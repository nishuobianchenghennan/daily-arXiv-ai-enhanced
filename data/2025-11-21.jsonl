However, the inherent randomness and stochastic nature of binary options make price movements highly unpredictable, posing significant challenges for any forecasting approach. This study demonstrates that machine learning algorithms struggle to outperform a simple baseline in predicting binary options movements. Using a dataset of EUR/USD currency pairs from 2021 to 2023, we tested multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), both before and after hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, several neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, were evaluated under different training conditions. Despite these exhaustive efforts, none of the models surpassed the ZeroR baseline accuracy, highlighting the inherent randomness of binary options. These findings reinforce the notion that binary options lack predictable patterns, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting."}

Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $π$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $π$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system."}

However, these advantages also introduce challenges in probing and controlling AFM order, thereby restricting their practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate an all-electric control and probing of the AFM order in heavy metal (HM)/AFM insulator (AFMI) heterostructures on a ferroelectric substrate at room temperature (RT). The AFM order was detected by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and manipulated by the ferroelectric field effect as well as the piezoelectric effect in heterostructures of Pt/NiO/0.7Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$--0.3PbTiO$_{3}$ (PMN--PT). The non-volatile control of AFM order gives rise to a 33\\% modulation of AHE, which is further evidenced by synchrotron-based X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). Combined with the $in$-$situ$ piezoelectric response of AHE, we demonstrate that ferroelectric polarization contributes mainly to the control of the AFM order. Our results are expected to have broader implications for efficient spintronic devices."}

We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications."}

The origin of these features is attributed to reorientational transitions (DeltaJ = 0; Q0-branch), which shift from the Rayleigh line as anisotropic intermolecular interactions lift the mJ degeneracy. This family of excitations closely follows the behavior of the S0-branches, sharing their dependence on pressure, temperature, and ortho-H2 concentration. Above 65 K, spectra corrected by the Bose-Einstein population factor reveal a broad continuum arising from populated higher J-states and increased ortho-para disorder. Upon entering phase III, where molecular rotation is inhibited, this continuum is quenched, giving way to well-established optical phonons. Below 25 K, equilibrated samples demonstrate a fine structure from isolated and pair excitations from impurity ortho-H2 molecules in a parahydrogen lattice, the latter a sensitive probe to anisotropic intermolecular interactions relevant to the quantum modeling of solid H2."}

However, achieving reproducibility remains a major challenge, particularly for air-sensitive materials such as $Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+δ}$ (BSCCO), where it is crucial to preserve the intrinsic and delicate superconducting properties of the interface throughout the entire fabrication process. Here, we present a dry, inert and cryogenic assembly method that combines silicon nitride nanomembranes (NMBs) with pre-patterned electrodes and the cryogenic stacking technique (CST) to fabricate high-quality twisted BSCCO Josephson junctions (JJs). This protocol prevents thermal and chemical degradation during both interface formation and electrical contact integration. We also find that asymmetric membrane designs, such as a double cantilever, effectively suppress vibration-induced disorder due to wire bonding, resulting in sharp and hysteretic current-voltage characteristics. The junctions exhibit a twist-angle-dependent Josephson coupling with magnitudes comparable to the highest-performing devices reported to date, but achieved through a straightforward and versatile contact method, offering a scalable and adaptable platform for future applications. These findings highlight the importance of both interface and contact engineering in addressing reproducibility in superconducting van der Waals heterostructures."}

The enhanced stiffness originates from extended regions of vanishing gap around the nodal lines of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Our study, based on mean-field and BKT theory, presents a comparative analysis of $s$-wave and $d$-wave scenarios, highlighting the features of the latter that boost the stiffness and the BKT transition temperature (T$_{BKT}$). The comparison focuses on two quantities: the mean-field critical temperature and the maximum superconducting gap related to the pairing strengths. We present a phase diagram showing the scaling of T$_{BKT}$ with respect to the mean-field critical temperature across the BCS-BEC crossover and the evolution of the pseudogap. We also present a zero-temperature phase-stiffness intensity map over the Brillouin zone, displaying a two-component structure consisting of low- and high-stiffness regions whose extent depends on microscopic parameters.

In these materials, precise quantization is limited to low temperatures, with the activation energy for dissipative transport typically in the range of 1 K. One potential source of dissipative transport is non-chiral edge states. These states are expected to be present in sufficiently thick samples. In this work, we perform extensive Hall and non-local resistance measurements in a Hall bar geometry at 2 K. By comparing 15 independent transport measurements to different transport models, we find that the system behavior is well-described by a simple continuum Ohm's law model. The addition of non-chiral edge states into the model does not significantly improve the fitting, and we conclude that there is not strong evidence for these states.

Post-processing tools parse VASP outputs, compute mean-square displacements (MSD), and extract tracer diffusivities using the Einstein relation with robust error estimates through block averaging. Diagnostic plots, including MSD curves, running slopes, and velocity autocorrelations, are produced automatically to help identify diffusive regimes.

In contrast to previous work, where the magnetic field was directed along the $ab$ plane ($B \\parallel ab$), the influence of the field on the sample is stronger due to the contribution of both spin--orbit and Zeeman effects. It was found that the BEC--BCS transition temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{pair}}$, which corresponds to the maximum of the $Δ^*(T)$ dependence, shifts to the region of lower temperatures with increasing $B$, and the maximum value of $Δ^*(T_{\\mathrm{pair}})$ decreases in fields $B > 5$~T. It was found that with increasing field, the low-temperature maximum near $T_0$ is smeared and disappears at $B > 1$~T. In addition, above the Ginzburg temperature $T_G$, for $B > 1$~T, a minimum appears on $Δ^*(T)$ at $T_{\\min}$, which becomes very pronounced with a subsequent increase in $B$.

In the $α$ phase, the simulations confirm the triple-well character of the potential energy surface for octahedral tilting shedding light into the local dynamic distortions. In the $β$ phase, our simulations reveal MA sublattice doubling yielding both orientationally disordered and ordered MA ions mirroring experimental observation. This mixed-order phase results from locally frustrated host-guest couplings arising from the in-phase octahedral tilt system ($a^+a^+a^+$). In the high-pressure $γ$ phase, we confirm the formation of polar and anti-polar domains, with the latter have higher lifetimes and persist for over 50 ps at pressures above 1.5 GPa.

Many of these phenomena are highly sensitive to the twist angle, which can be deliberately tuned to tailor the interlayer interactions. This makes the twist angle a critical tunable parameter, emphasizing the need for precise control and accurate characterization during device fabrication. In particular, twisted cuprate heterostructures based on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x have demonstrated angle-dependent superconducting properties, positioning the twist angle as a key tunable parameter. However, the twisted interface is highly unstable under ambient conditions and vulnerable to damage from conventional characterization tools such as electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques. In this work, we introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for determining twist angles in artificially stacked BSCCO heterostructures. By analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, particularly utilizing the out-of-plane A1g vibrational mode of Bi/Sr at 116 cm-1, we identify clear optical fingerprints of the rotational misalignment between cuprate layers.

Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological \"pins\" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales.

I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless.

The method is motivated by the dynamics of non-Newtonian mechanical systems, where conventional momentum schemes can be interpreted as a dynamical model with quadratic kinetic energy and linear damping. Based on this analogy, a generalized optimization dynamics is constructed by extending the kinetic energy formulation and incorporating a nonlinear damping term. An anharmonic kinetic energy function can be employed to represent the inertial effect of accumulated gradient information during the iterations, while the nonlinear damping mechanism enables a more flexible control of the momentum contribution along the convergence trajectory. Numerical experiments indicate that the method exhibits faster convergence and higher robustness compared to classical momentum algorithms. Moreover, its strong performance on nonconvex objectives makes it particularly suitable for inverse photonic design problems.

This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $χ^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches.

We confront the minimally modifred tri-bimaximal mixing pattern with the new data. Before the measurement of a non-zero $θ_{13}$ mixing angle, the tri-bimximal mixing pattern predicting $θ_{13}$ to be zero is one of the most popular simple ones. Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. One minimal scheme is to keep one of the coloums unchanged by modifing the neutrino mass matrix in models based on $A_4$ flavor symmetry. Three mixing patterms ermergy, a) the third, b) the second and c) the first column in the $3\\times 3$ mixing matrix separately unchaged. The option a) mantains the feature that $θ_{13}=0$ which is in conflect with data on $θ_{13}$ and therefore is ruled out. The option b) is the interesting mixing pattern with $θ_{13}$ nonzero, but predicts $V_{e2} = 1/\\sqrt{3}$ with interesting predictions for CP violation and other mixing angles. The new $θ_{12}$ value measured by JUNO with $|V_{e2}|$ is, however, smaller than $1/\\sqrt{3}$ at a more than 3.5$σ$ level making the search for alternative new paterns desirable.

Here, we investigate antiferromagnetism in atomically thin van der Waals magnet NiPS3 using magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices. Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples. While bilayer and multilayer NiPS3 exhibit a single magnetic phase transition into a zig-zag antiferromagnetic state driven by uniaxial anisotropy, monolayer NiPS3 undergoes two magnetic transitions, with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy. The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy."}

Inbetween measurements the samples were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Using a conservative classification of sp$^3$-type spectra, based on the D/D' peak intensity ratio, we observed almost complete depletion of sp$^3$-type defects over the investigation period of about two years. This by far exceeds the ~5.5% annual reduction expected from tritium decay alone (~3x larger). This change in the defect composition is accompanied by a recovery of the 2D-band of graphene and an overall decrease in defect-density, as determined via the D/G intensity ratio. Hydogenated graphene is reported to be reasonably stable over several months, when kept under vacuum, but suffers substantial hydrogen loss under laboratory air conditions. While the results shown here for tritiated graphene exhibit similarities with hydrogenated graphene, however, some distinct differences are observed."}

The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution."}

While light quarks dominate the overall response, we find that charm quark contributions become strategically important when light quark contributions partially cancel. Beyond dipole moments, we predict higher multipoles -- electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments -- that fingerprint the spatial deformation of these states, revealing prolate versus oblate charge distributions. These results provide the first systematic predictions for electromagnetic moments of molecular pentaquark configurations, establishing essential benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental studies.

However, insulating materials that are both easily transferable, scalable and capable of withstanding high electric fields remain limited, and the search for such materials has attracted significant attention. Herein, a distinct and robust method is demonstrated for damage-free transfer of freestanding fluoropolymer insulating films onto a wide range of substrates including low-adhesion surfaces such as hydrogen-terminated diamond. Water-soluble sacrificial layer allows the exfoliation of fluoropolymer films with peripheral support, enabling their transfer as uniform freestanding films, which exhibit root-mean-square roughness of $0.45 {\\pm} 0.03$ nm. These films reveal high breakdown fields exceeding $7$ MV cm$^{-1}$, with leakage current density remaining below ${10}^{-8}$ A cm$^{-2}$ before the breakdown. The incorporation of these fluoropolymer films as gate dielectrics in p-channel hydrogen-terminated diamond field-effect transistors results in transfer and output characteristics with negligible hysteresis, enhanced channel mobility (${\\approx}400$ cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and a low interface trap density (${\\le}3{\\times}10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$eV$^{-1}$).

Most theoretical works to date rely on the brute-force exact diagonalization which is limited to the one partially occupied band. In this work, we present strong evidence that the effect of higher lying bands cannot be ignored due to strong interband interactions. To tackle these effects, we introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally developed for problems in quantum chemistry. We apply this methodology to twisted MoTe2 at fractional hole fillings of ν = 1/3 and 2/3 across a spectrum of twist angles. Our results show that at ν = 1/3, the many-body excitation energy gaps are substantially reduced compared to the one-band treatment. For ν = 2/3, we find that the dynamic correlations stemming from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, consistent with the experimental findings. By examining the correlated orbitals and their single-particle topological features, we demonstrate that this stabilization at higher twist angles arises predominantly from the dynamic correlations, rather than conditions on the single-particle quantum geometric tensor."}

Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches.

Focusing on the photocatalytic properties of these layers, we investigate the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on the MSSe layers in the presence of metalloid dopants B, Si, and Ge. The layers in their pristine form exhibit positive adsorption energies, indicating an endothermic nature. Substitution of a dopant in the pristine MSSe layers alters the local symmetry, bonding character, and charge distribution, thereby increasing the number of active sites for hosting H adsorption and reducing the adsorption energy. We select distinct sites, both atomic and interstitial, for the substitution of dopants. The energetics of the H atom at various sites is studied to find the most favorable active site on the MSSe Janus layers. Our results based on density functional theory calculations show that the adsorption process becomes spontaneous and less attractive in the presence of atomic site dopant substitution, whereas the interstitial site results in an endothermic behavior. Moreover, having the data from DFT, we develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting the hydrogen adsorption energy. For this purpose, we utilize 23 elemental features of the atoms involved in the structure, thereby eliminating the need for DFT calculations in feature design. The dimensionality reduction technique, principal component analysis, is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, yielding independent features that are mutually orthogonal. The model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron regressor with two hidden layers. The data augmentation technique is employed to artificially expand the dataset size, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the neural network model by 0.90% on the testing data."}

Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Neél order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis."}

Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $α$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($μ$eV) precision.

Then, we apply the theory to twisted and strained moiré materials, mainly focusing on the hexagonal homobilayers, hexagonal heterobilayers and monoclinic lattices. Special moiré geometries, like the quasi-unidimensional patterns, square patterns and hexagonal, are theoretically predicted by manipulating the strain and twist. Finally, we review recently developed strain techniques and the special moiré geometries realized via these approaches. This review aims at equipping the reader with a robust understanding on the description and implementation of strain in moiré materials, as well as highlight some major breakthroughs in this active field."}

The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity.

The dynamics of cosmic string loops with time-varying tension can produce cosmic string loop trackers in which most of the energy density of the universe lies in the form of string loops. This solution can exist as an attractor until the rolling modulus reaches its minimum, when the loops ultimately decay through gravitational wave emission. We explore the spectrum of gravitational waves produced by such string loop trackers. The resulting spectrum is high-frequency and peaks in the GHz regime today. The amplitude of the signal is diluted by any subsequent matter-dominated epochs, and thus the potential observability of the signal crucially depends on the duration of the moduli-dominated epoch that follows once the moduli settle down and oscillate about their minimum."}

In stark contrast to Euclidean crystals, where the Goldstone theorem ensures that acoustic phonon modes are gapless, hyperbolic lattices with coordination number $z > 2d$ exhibit a finite bulk phonon gap. We identify the origin of this breakdown: the Goldstone modes here belong to nonunitary representations of the translation group and therefore cannot form gapless excitation branches. We further show that when boundaries are included, this bulk spetrum gap is filled by an extensive number of low-frequency boundary modes."}

We directly observe the initial lithiation driven formation of Li2Pt and its evolution to a stable LiPt intermetallic phase during extended cycling via a solid solution type reaction mechanism. Simultaneously, the solid electrolyte interphase transitions from an unstable carbonate rich to a stable LiF dominated composition, confirmed by cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography reveals spatially distinct compositional regimes within the alloy anode, including lithium flux limited, heterogeneous interfacial zone and a diffusion controlled, homogeneous LiPt alloy bulk. This nanoscale compositional gradient rationalises the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism and highlights how kinetic limitations and interface dynamics govern alloy formation and electrochemical stability.

We clarify the origin of this ambiguity by demonstrating that the \"intrinsic\" response is not universal, but is inextricably linked to the dissipation mechanism that establishes the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We establish a benchmark by solving the exact NESS density matrix for a generic Bloch system coupled to a featureless fermionic bath. Our exact $Γ^0$ conductivity decomposes into two parts: (i) a geometric contribution, $σ^{\\text{geo}}$, whose form recovers the intraband quantum metric dipole ($\\sim\\partial_k g$), providing an exact derivation that clarifies inconsistencies in the literature, and (ii) a novel, purely kinetic contribution, $σ^{\\text{kin}} \\propto v^3 f^{(4)}_0$, which is absent when dissipation is modeled by white-noise disorder (e.g., a constant-$Γ$ Green's function model).

The 55:45 composition evolves toward rhombohedral $R3c$ symmetry with lattice contraction, suppression of Sillenite- and Mullite-type impurities, and markedly reduced vibrational disorder, yielding homogeneous grains with near-Debye dielectric relaxation ($n > 0.9$), low CPE prefactors, and a four-orders-of-magnitude increase in bulk AC conductivity upon sintering at 775$^\\circ$C. In contrast, the Bi-rich 70:30 samples retain expanded lattice volumes, defective grain boundaries, and highly depressed Nyquist arcs ($n < 0.5$), reflecting persistent structural disorder and stabilisation of insulating secondary phases.

Prediction of accurate thermal boundary resistance (TBR) across these interfaces, considering realistic structures and their correlation with underlying thermal transport, remains challenging. In this work we develop a unified Neuroevolution Potential (NEP) for the Si-Ti system that accurately reproduces energies, forces, and phonon properties of bulk Si, Ti, and TiSi2 and extends naturally to interfacial environments to analyze interfacial transport. An important development over current machine-learned interatomic potentials is the capability to model complex structures at metal-semiconductor interfaces, as the NEP enables large scale non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of epitaxial Si/Ti interfaces to elucidate the effect of amorphous or crystalline silicide interfacial layers. Simulated TBRs show excellent agreement with our time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) measurements. Spectral analyses reveal that amorphous TiSi2 interfacial layer helps in efficient interfacial transport when the thickness is less than 1.5 nm compared to the crystalline TiSi2 layer, but this trend reverses when the interfacial layer thickness increases beyond 1.5 nm. Comparison of TBRs at Si/TiSi2 interface for different crystalline phases of TiSi2 establishes that C54 phase has reduced TBR compared to C49 phase, which is correlated with the difference in their phonon density of states (PDOS) overlap with Si. These results provide atomistic insight into the role of crystalline versus amorphous silicides in interfacial heat transport and demonstrate a transferable machine-learned potential for studying heat dissipation in advanced semiconductor devices."}

To better understand the properties of the scaling regime, we then numerically extract the Equal Time Correlator (ETC) of the energy-momentum tensor of the network, thus determining its characteristic shape for the case of domain walls, and verifying explicitly its functional dependence as predicted by scaling arguments. The ETC can be further extended to the Unequal Time Correlator (UTC) controlling the GW emission by making assumptions on the coherence of the source. By comparison with the actual GW spectrum evaluated by CosmoLattice, we are then able to infer the degree of coherence of the domain wall network. Finally, by performing numerical simulations in different background cosmologies, e.g. radiation domination and kination, we find evidence for a universal ETC at subhorizon scales and hence a universal shape of the GW spectrum in the UV, while the expansion history of the Universe may instead be determined by the IR features of the GW spectrum."}

Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack."}

We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications."}

Another neutrino source that has received far less attention is binary neutron star mergers. Including the data from recent simulations, we find that detection in current and near-future neutrino experiments is not feasible, and a megaton-scale detector with $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV threshold, such as the proposed Deep-TITAND, MEMPHYS, or MICA, will be required. This is due to the updated binary neutron star merger rate and the time-of-flight delay caused by the nonzero neutrino mass. Regarding the former, recent results from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has significantly lowered the upper limit on the neutron star merger rate. As for the latter, neutrino events from neutron star mergers are expected to be recorded shortly after the gravitational wave signal. Limiting the analysis to such short time windows can significantly reduce background rates. While this approach has been qualitatively discussed in the literature, the effect of the time delay caused by neutrino mass, which can substantially extend the observation windows, has been disregarded. We present a refined analysis employing energy-dependent time windows and luminosity distance cuts for the mergers and provide realistic estimates of the detector runtime required to record neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers with small background contamination. The relative timing between the neutrino and gravitational wave signals can also be employed to probe the scale of neutrino mass. We find that the sensitivity to the lightest neutrino mass exceeds both the most stringent terrestrial bounds from KATRIN and the projections based on galactic supernovae. This level of sensitivity may become particularly relevant in the future if terrestrial and supernova constraints are not significantly improved."}

However, insulating materials that are both easily transferable, scalable and capable of withstanding high electric fields remain limited, and the search for such materials has attracted significant attention. Herein, a distinct and robust method is demonstrated for damage-free transfer of freestanding fluoropolymer insulating films onto a wide range of substrates including low-adhesion surfaces such as hydrogen-terminated diamond. Water-soluble sacrificial layer allows the exfoliation of fluoropolymer films with peripheral support, enabling their transfer as uniform freestanding films, which exhibit root-mean-square roughness of $0.45 {\\pm} 0.03$ nm. These films reveal high breakdown fields exceeding $7$ MV cm$^{-1}$, with leakage current density remaining below ${10}^{-8}$ A cm$^{-2}$ before the breakdown. The incorporation of these fluoropolymer films as gate dielectrics in p-channel hydrogen-terminated diamond field-effect transistors results in transfer and output characteristics with negligible hysteresis, enhanced channel mobility (${\\approx}400$ cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and a low interface trap density (${\\le}3{\\times}10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$eV$^{-1}$). These findings highlight the versatility of the transfer method and establish freestanding fluoropolymers as a practical alternative to deposited dielectrics for forming high-quality dielectric/semiconductor interfaces for advanced electronics."}

Our findings establish that BiPt is a weak type-II superconductor with a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.2 K which exhibits pronounced anisotropic superconducting characteristics attributed to its hexagonal crystal structure.

In this work we demonstrate that such topological transition exists in some range of the uniaxial anisotropy values.

Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological \"pins\" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales. Our results establish skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable, topologically heterogeneous magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamical properties, paving the way for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications."}

Probing the magnetic phase diagram of these monolayers remains however challenging because established experimental techniques often lack the required sensitivity. Here, we investigate antiferromagnetism in atomically thin van der Waals magnet NiPS3 using magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices. Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples. While bilayer and multilayer NiPS3 exhibit a single magnetic phase transition into a zig-zag antiferromagnetic state driven by uniaxial anisotropy, monolayer NiPS3 undergoes two magnetic transitions, with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy. The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy."}

First, starting from the linear elasticity theory, we briefly introduce the general formalism of small deformations in two-dimensional materials, and discuss the particular cases of uniaxial, shear and biaxial strain. Then, we apply the theory to twisted and strained moiré materials, mainly focusing on the hexagonal homobilayers, hexagonal heterobilayers and monoclinic lattices. Special moiré geometries, like the quasi-unidimensional patterns, square patterns and hexagonal, are theoretically predicted by manipulating the strain and twist.
