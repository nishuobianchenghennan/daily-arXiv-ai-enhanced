However, in some cases, different\nemission spectra can be detected in samples with similar Racah parameters. The\npresent paper reports changes in the luminescence properties of Cr3+:YGG\nnanocrystals. Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals were synthesized by a modified Pechini\nmethod to obtain nanocrystals containing two fractions of Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals\nwith different lattice parameters and crystalline sizes. The increase in the\nconcentration of Cr3+ ions leads to a redshift of the 4T2g emission from 750 nm\nto 850 nm for luminescence spectra measured at 80K. In contrast, room\ntemperature luminescence spectra showed similarity in the shape of the emission\nspectra. The calculated crystal field strength was found to increase with the\nconcentration of Cr3+ ions, so the detected patterns in low-temperature\nluminescence spectra were explained by energy transfer chain processes."}

WimPyC is an extension of the\nWimPyDD code, that calculates WIMP-nucleus scattering signals in direct\ndetection (DD) experiments, and allows to combine DD and capture in celestial\nbodies in virtually any scenario within the framework of Galilean-invariant\nnon-relativistic effective theory (NREFT), including inelastic scattering, an\narbitrary WIMP spin and a generic WIMP velocity distribution in the Galactic\nhalo. WimPyDD and WimPyC are suitable for both top-down approaches, where the\ninteraction operators of a high-energy physics model are matched to those of\nthe NREFT, and to bottom-up studies, where the Wilson coefficients of the NREFT\nare explored in a model-independent way and/or where the velocity distribution\nis written in terms of a superposition of streams taken as free parameters. As\nin the case of WimPyDD WimPyC exploits the factorization of the three main\ncomponents that enter in the calculation of the capture rate: i) the Wilson\ncoefficients that encode the dependence of the signals on the ultraviolet\ncompletion of the effective theory; ii) a response function that depends on the\nnuclear physics; iii) the halo function that depends on the WIMP velocity\ndistribution. In WimPyC these three components are calculated and stored\nseparately for later interpolation and combined together only as the last step\nof the signal evaluation procedure. This makes the phenomenological study of\nthe capture rate with WimPyC transparent and improves computational speed."}

Crucially, applying a brief\nin-plane ``set'' magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and\namplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission\nelectron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations\nreveal that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a\ndense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field\napplication, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Thus,\nmodifying the initial domain configuration by in-plane fields enables precise\ncontrol of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond\ntimescales and potentially even of topology."}
