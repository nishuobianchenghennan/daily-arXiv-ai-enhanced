We discuss a new mechanism of interaction between electromagnetic waves and the localized spins in disordered superconductors. A supercurrent induces randomly distributed spin density of the itinerant electrons, which couples to the impurity spins by exchange interaction. Acceleration of the Cooper pair condensate by the external AC electric field of frequency $ω$ creates a strong, time-dependent exchange field acting on the localized spins, which is inversely proportional to $ω$. As a result, the low-frequency dissipative part of the conductivity saturates to a nonzero value. We use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to evaluate the spectrum of equilibrium current fluctuations associated with the fluctuation in the spin subsystem. We also predict that in the presence of a DC magnetic field parallel to the superconducting film, the system of spins exhibits a large positive magnetoconductance."}

The dominant solution of the linearized gap equation shows nodal gaps when the surface state bandwidth is comparable to the maximum phonon energy, as is the case in PtBi$_2$. We further predict that if the screening of Coulomb interaction on the surface is enhanced by Coulomb engineering, the superconducting gap becomes nodeless, and the critical temperature increases."}

In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $Φ_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $π$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $π$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $π$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current.

We found that while the lattice constants exhibit slight deviations at the Neel temperature(TN), due to spin phonon interactions, individual interatomic bonds display distinct behavior. The octahedral B site basal plane, involving oxygen ion pairs that mediate superexchange interactions, displays bond contraction (or elongation) assimilable to the observed in x ray diffraction for negative thermal expansion. These bond deviations reach a singular point near TN, where a sharp change in bond length is observed. A similar abrupt change is also detected in the nearest neighbor La O2 basal plane distances, which we interpret as arising from ion size differences within the 3d 2p hybridized states associated with the superexchange mechanism. High-resolution SXRD measurements of the c-axis Fe3+ O1 and La3+ O1 apex distances reveal a distinct inflection at the Neel temperature. This behavior supports the role of lattice distortions and crystal field modifications in the emergence of non collinear weak ferromagnetism in RFeO3 (R = rare earth) perovskites. Furthermore, our SXRD patterns show an increase in diffraction line intensities peaking at TN, suggesting a straightforward indicator for spin-phonon interactions that also resolves into lattice metastability deduced by nonlinear thermal expansion in the paramagnetic phase.

Conventionally, transitions between Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and other topological states rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or precise manipulation of lattice symmetry, thus constraints the available control strategies and restrict the scope of viable material systems. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for TPT that operates without TRS breaking or lattice symmetry modification: a class of semiconductors can be directly transformed into an ideal WSM via bandgap closure. This transition is driven by chemical doping, which simultaneously modulates the band gap and enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC), leading to band inversion between the valence and conduction bands and thereby triggering the TPT. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism in the Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials, where two pairs of Weyl points emerge with energies extremely close to the Fermi level. The bulk Fermi surface becomes nearly point-like, while the surface Fermi surface consists exclusively of Fermi arcs. This symmetry-independent mechanism bypasses the constraints of conventional symmetry-based engineering, and also offers an ideal platform for probing the anomalous transport properties of WSMs."}

This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states. Our study establishes a universal and precise method for characterizing higher-order topological phases, opening avenues for their fundamental understanding and future investigations."}

For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems."}

However, from the perspective of forming a macroscopic flow pattern optimized for heat-exchange efficiency, a uniform lattice is not necessarily the optimal configuration. This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability. To regulate the relative dominance of the hot and cold flows-effectively, the channel widths-within the heat exchanger, we adopt the isosurface threshold of the Primitive lattice as the design variable and construct an optimization scheme for the lattice distribution using the previously described macroscopic model. The optimization is subsequently carried out for a planar heat exchanger where the hot and cold fluids each follow U-shaped flow trajectories. The optimal solution was verified, and its validity was examined through detailed geometric analysis and experiments conducted using metal LPBF. The optimal solution derived from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance advantage over the uniform lattice in the experimental results. The optimal solution obtained from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the uniform lattice, with an average enhancement of 28.7% in the experimental results."}

It is well known that spin orientation driven polarization is a relativistic effect that widely occurs in various type-II multiferroics. However, a universal theory that describes such a phenomenon and directs the corresponding materials discovery is lacking. Here, we revisit the magnetic structures of collinear magnets and explore the spin-orientation-dependent phenomena therein. Based on symmetry principles, we analyze the spin point groups (SPGs) that are associated with collinear magnets in the non-relativistic regime, demonstrate how relativistic spin-orbit interaction reduces each SPG to various magnetic point groups that are associated with different magnetic alignments, and classify the SPGs with respect to spin orientation driven polarization. We employ our theory to elucidate the mechanisms of spin orientation driven polarization in a variety of type-II multiferroics. Combined with first-principles simulations, we further show that polarization may be driven in nonpolar collinear antiferromagnets (e.g., CuFeS$_2$) by reorienting their magnetic alignments. Our theory provides guidelines for designing and discovering materials with spin orientation driven polarization, which will benefit the development of spintronics based on type-II multiferroics and related materials."}

Here, through the combination of pulsed currents and reversed magnetic fields, we experimentally achieve skyrmion bundles with different integer Q values - reaching a maximum of 24 at above room temperature and zero magnetic field - in the chiral magnet Co8Zn10Mn2. We demonstrate the field-driven annihilation of high-Q bundles and present a phase diagram as a function of temperature and field.

Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \\textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. This mechanism accounts for the observed giant anomalous Hall effect in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ and GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$, thereby highlighting topologically trivial double-$Q$ spin textures as promising spintronic materials."}

In this work, the full classifications of SOTs in bulk collinear AFMs have been achieved based on magnetic point group. Dependent on the symmetries connecting the opposite spin sublattices, the SOTs are classified into six distinct types. Among them, the SOTs and the induced Neel vector dynamics in three representative AFMs have been investigated, where the spin sublattices are connected by fractional translation, spatial inversion, and neither by translation nor inversion symmetry respectively. The SOTs on spin sublattices have been calculated by first-principles calculations based on Kubo linear response theory, and then the induced spin dynamics are simulated by LLG equations. In typical PT symmetric AFM and the inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the simulations indicate that the deterministic switching of Neel vectors can be driven by field like torques. What's more, the fully electric writing of multiple antiferromagnetic domains into single domain state with preset Neel vector direction and 180 deterministic switching may also be realized. Our work may shed light on the current control of antiferromagnetic orders in collinear AFMs. Especially, for inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the electric writing and reading of Neel vector are highly desirable for antiferromagnetic memory applications."}

Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges.

Among other results, we show that polarization interference (i) is generally non-zero, even in on-shell limits, (ii) can be negative and comparable to longitudinal contributions, and (iii) is generated by helicity inversion and therefore suppressed (or zero) in high-energy limits for $s$- and $t$-channel exchanges. Connections between gauge invariance and the scalar polarization are also discussed, as is a scheme for reducing gauge dependence in predictions for polarized scattering rates. As case studies, we consider charged-current processes, including $W$(+jets), top quark decay, and neutrino deep-inelastic scattering."}

Combining dissimilar materials offers opportunities to create several functional heterostructures. Yet, assessing structural compatibility (the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth) is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters/crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end we implemented developments tailored for the efficient prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and using a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically extracted from the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface and assign a structure to many other reported metal halide/oxide based interfaces. The Ogre package is available on GitHub or via the OgreInterface desktop application, available for Windows, Linux and Mac."}

Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited."}

Their interpretation, however, is often complicated by edge effects, which arise when correlated particles fall outside the reconstructed jet radius, introducing distortions that obscure the underlying QCD dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive phenomenological study of edge effects in soft-insensitive angular observables, taking the two-point energy correlator (EEC) as a representative example. We argue that these distortions scale linearly with the average angular separation between the winner-take-all and $E$-scheme axes $\\langle φ\\rangle$, and validate this behavior across proton-proton (p-p) simulations with Pythia8 and Herwig7, as well as lead-lead (Pb-Pb) simulations using JEWEL and CoLBT. In p-p collisions, edge effects are strongly suppressed, scaling as $(R_L/R)^4$, whereas medium-modified jets can exhibit larger distortions, with contributions scaling as $(R_L/R)^2$ and $(R_L/R)^4$. Taking Pb-Pb/p-p ratios of the EEC substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, these distortions, highlighting the need of accounting for edge effects in the interpretation of heavy-ion jet substructure measurements. Since edge effects are largely governed by the $\\langle φ\\rangle$ distribution, studying this distribution provides a new handle for benchmarking and constraining the modeling of edge effects in heavy-ion event generators."}

We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched \"on\" and \"off\" by the electric fields.

Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $ω=(Nα)^2Υ(ε,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $α$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $Υ$ depends on the dielectric constant $ε$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$.

At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems."}

Scaling down the film thickness is a necessary step to prolong the lifetime of amorphous Sb, but the optical properties of Sb are also significantly altered as the thickness is reduced to a few nanometers, adding complexity to device optimization. In this work, we aim to provide atomistic understanding of the thickness-dependent optical responses in Sb thin films. As thickness decreases, both the extinction coefficient and optical contrast reduce in the near-infrared spectrum, consistent with previous optical measurements. Such thickness dependence gives rise to a bottom thickness limit of 2 nm in photonic applications, as predicted by coarse-grained device simulations. Further bonding analysis reveals a fundamentally different behavior for amorphous and crystalline Sb upon downscaling, resulting in the reduction of optical contrast. Thin film experiments are also carried out to validate our predictions. The thickness-dependent optical trend is fully demonstrated by our ellipsometric spectroscopy experiments, and the bottom thickness limit of 2 nm is confirmed by structural characterization experiments. Finally, we show that the greatly improved amorphous-phase stability of the 2 nm Sb thin film enables robust and reversible optical switching in a silicon-based waveguide device."}

The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition."}

The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions."}

However, particles with masses at or above the Planck scale cannot be elementary; instead, they must exist as composite objects with finite spatial extent. Such spatially extended dark matter models lead to distinctive phenomenology in these detectors, particularly when the dark matter also interacts through long-range forces with their own characteristic length scales. In this work, we study the sensitivity of quantum sensor arrays to composite, ultraheavy dark matter interacting via both gravity and a novel Yukawa force. We consider three phenomenologically motivated density profiles -- a tophat, a Gaussian, and an exponential -- and contrast their signals with the point-like limit. Using a Monte Carlo analysis based on the predicted impulse signals and estimates of thermal and quantum noise, we obtain sensitivity projections for a future realization of a quantum sensor array. We find a non-trivial interplay between the dark-matter scale radius, the inter-sensor spacing, and the Yukawa screening length. Future accelerometer arrays would provide valuable information about the mass and size of composite ultraheavy dark matter, and our work will help to characterize the signatures of different theoretical models of ultraheavy dark matter."}

The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field."}

We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime.

As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder.

While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $Φ_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $π$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $π$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

Namely, the dominant decay channel of $Λ\\to pπ^-$ can contribute to $Λ\\to nπ^0$ via the $pπ^-\\to nπ^0$ rescatterings. This is a leading correction effect for $Λ\\to nπ^0$ at the one-loop level. We find that such FSIs only become the leading effects in $Λ\\to nπ^0$, but contribute as subleading contributions in other channels. We also demonstrate that the pole terms are indispensable in these hyperon decays. In particular, for $Σ^-\\to nπ^-$ and $Σ^+\\to nπ^+$, it shows that $Λ(1405)$ as the intermediate state in the pole term amplitude is necessary for reproducing the experimental data. We also find that a dynamic selection rule forbids the radial excitation state $N(1710)$ of the quark model multiplet $|70, ^28,2,0^+,1/2^+\\rangle$ from contribution. To some extent, the hyperon hadronic weak decays serve as a special probe for the underlying transition mechanisms and can provide some constraints on the intermediate $J^P=1/2^\\pm$ baryon resonances."}

In free-standing ferroic thin films, where elastic interactions are highly thickness dependent, understanding DW behaviour across length scales and external stimuli is crucial. A thickness-dependent monopolar-to-dipolar crossover in elastic DW behaviour has been reported; however, how temperature influences this regime remains unexplored. Here, LaAlO3 thin films spanning the dipolar ($<200$ nm) and crossover (200-300 nm) regimes are investigated using in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach. By tracking DW curvature and density from above $T_C$ (approximately $550,^\\circ$C) to room temperature (RT), a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness is identified. In the dipolar regime, DWs are mobile and curved near $T_C$ and gradually freeze upon cooling, consistent with the well-known temperature freezing regime. In contrast, within the crossover regime, DWs are nearly static, with minimal reconfiguration through cooling and curvature an order of magnitude lower at RT. These results map the evolution of DWs across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes, revealing how thickness and temperature govern DW morphology and dynamics, and providing insight relevant for domain engineering in free-standing oxide thin films."}

Conventionally, transitions between Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and other topological states rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or precise manipulation of lattice symmetry, thus constraints the available control strategies and restrict the scope of viable material systems. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for TPT that operates without TRS breaking or lattice symmetry modification: a class of semiconductors can be directly transformed into an ideal WSM via bandgap closure. This transition is driven by chemical doping, which simultaneously modulates the band gap and enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC), leading to band inversion between the valence and conduction bands and thereby triggering the TPT. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism in the Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials, where two pairs of Weyl points emerge with energies extremely close to the Fermi level. The bulk Fermi surface becomes nearly point-like, while the surface Fermi surface consists exclusively of Fermi arcs. This symmetry-independent mechanism bypasses the constraints of conventional symmetry-based engineering, and also offers an ideal platform for probing the anomalous transport properties of WSMs."}

Starting from the UV completion and one-loop-matched Wilson coefficient $C_{NB}$ of the gauge-invariant operator $O_{NB}=(\\bar{L}σ^{μν}P_RN)\\tilde{H}B_{μν}$, we compute the radiatively induced Weinberg operator $O_5$ and derive the light Majorana mass matrix generated by a double insertion of $O_{NB}$. For the benchmarks that realise successful resonant electromagnetic leptogenesis at the electroweak scale, these contributions yield neutrino masses far below the scale implied by neutrino oscillation data, so that the observed neutrino masses must originate from additional interactions such as one of the seesaw mechanisms, and only in extreme corners of parameter space do they saturate the cosmological bound on $\\sum m_ν$. We also show that no additional Dirac neutrino mass is generated at one loop by the dipole operator alone. Furthermore, we derive the charged-lepton dipole operator $O_{eγ}$ in LEFT, accounting for one-loop operator mixing in the symmetric phase and two-loop Barr--Zee--type graphs in the broken phase, and evolve its Wilson coefficient $C_{eγ}$ down to the muon and electron mass scales using QED renormalisation-group equations. The resulting analytic upper bounds on $\\mathrm{BR}(μ\\to eγ)$, the electron EDM, and $(g-2)_μ$ lie many orders of magnitude below current experimental sensitivities throughout the BAU-compatible region.

Recently, a strontium cyanurate compound was found to undergo a phase transition from a high-symmetry $β$-phase to a low-symmetry ferroelectric $α$-phase when the temperature was reduced.

Acceleration of the Cooper pair condensate by the external AC electric field of frequency $ω$ creates a strong, time-dependent exchange field acting on the localized spins, which is inversely proportional to $ω$. As a result, the low-frequency dissipative part of the conductivity saturates to a nonzero value. We use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to evaluate the spectrum of equilibrium current fluctuations associated with the fluctuation in the spin subsystem.

We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched \"on\" and \"off\" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at <=40% noise levels.

Here, we demonstrate that the binary Heusler alloy Cr3Al despite adopting a fully A2-disordered structure exhibits a rare coexistence of SGS transport and a fully compensated ferrimagnetic (FCF) ground state. Single-crystalline and polycrystalline Cr3Al samples were synthesized, and comprehensive structural analyses using single crystal XRD, synchrotron powder XRD, and neutron powder diffraction reveal complete Cr/Al site mixing. Remarkably, this chemical disorder does not disrupt magnetic order; instead, magnetization, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and temperature-dependent neutron diffraction establish a robust compensated ferrimagnetic state with a vanishingly small ordered moment of 0.1(1) muB/f.u and a high Curie temperature of 773(2) K. Electrical and thermal transport measurements uncover clear SGS characteristics, including weak temperature-dependent conductivity, very low Seebeck coefficients, and electron-hole compensated transport. Hall measurements show unusual temperature-dependent carrier concentrations consistent with disorder-modified electronic states. First-principles calculations on an A2-disordered SQS structure reproduce the experimentally observed negligibly small magnetization (0.0072 muB/f.u) and reveal a vanishing spin-up band gap unambiguously supporting SGS behavior driven by chemical disorder.

We also find that the reverse intersystem crossing rates $k_{RISC}$ values are higher where $ΔE_{ST}$ values are closer to reorganization energy. Furthermore, a small change in the absorption peak of optical absorption spectra with and without spin orbit coupling (SOC) is observed for each emitter.

We find that the $φ$ meson exhibits a strong \"glue-like\" effect, binding the $0^+_1$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ resonant states of $^8$Be into stable states and significantly reducing the $α$-$α$ distance. In contrast, the interactions of $J/ψ$ and $η_c$ with the nucleus are weaker, forming only shallow bound states with the $0^+_1$ state of $^8$Be and even increasing the $α$-$α$ separation. Notably, our analysis predicts weakly bound $α$-$J/ψ$ states in the $^4S_{3/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ channels, a result not reported in prior studies, which suggests that $^{9}_{J/ψ}{\\text{Be}}$ may not be a Borromean nucleus. The sensitivity of the $^{9}_φ{\\text{Be}}(4^+_1)$ state-transitioning from bound to resonant depending on the $α$-particle radius-highlights the subtle dynamics at play. These results provide a systematic theoretical comparison of how different vector mesons modify nuclear clustering, offering critical predictions for future experimental searches of such exotic hadron-nucleus systems."}

Single-crystalline and polycrystalline Cr3Al samples were synthesized, and comprehensive structural analyses using single crystal XRD, synchrotron powder XRD, and neutron powder diffraction reveal complete Cr/Al site mixing. Remarkably, this chemical disorder does not disrupt magnetic order; instead, magnetization, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and temperature-dependent neutron diffraction establish a robust compensated ferrimagnetic state with a vanishingly small ordered moment of 0.1(1) muB/f.u and a high Curie temperature of 773(2) K. Electrical and thermal transport measurements uncover clear SGS characteristics, including weak temperature-dependent conductivity, very low Seebeck coefficients, and electron-hole compensated transport. Hall measurements show unusual temperature-dependent carrier concentrations consistent with disorder-modified electronic states. First-principles calculations on an A2-disordered SQS structure reproduce the experimentally observed negligibly small magnetization (0.0072 muB/f.u) and reveal a vanishing spin-up band gap unambiguously supporting SGS behavior driven by chemical disorder.

We discuss three representative realizations of electroweak right-handed neutrinos arising from the Type-I seesaw mechanism, spanning small, large, and ultraweak couplings to the standard model sector, so that the dark particles can either undergo secluded freeze-out or be produced via freeze-in. Instead of merely estimating the order of magnitude of the seesaw couplings, we use the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to obtain viable seesaw parameter sets consistent with neutrino data and other constraints, and then compute the coupled evolution of the dark particles and right-handed neutrinos, reproducing the observed dark matter relic abundance in representative benchmark scenarios. For the freeze-in case, we show that internal dark sector interactions can significantly modify the predicted relic density: treating each hidden particle as an independent freeze-in component and simply adding late decays can misestimate the final dark matter abundance by $30\\%$, or even $95\\%$, depending on the type of internal interactions, compared to a full solution of the coupled Boltzmann equations for all dark species, including the dark sector temperature.

One of the previously used methods provides this form factor in the region of spacelike momentum transfer, $q^2<0$, matching the result to the hadronic dispersion relation, which is then continued to the physical region. The calculation done so far was a combination of QCD factorisation for hard-gluon contributions with light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) for soft-gluon ones. In this work, we calculate for the first time the complete nonlocal form factor at $q^2<0$ for one of the effective operators, the chromomagnetic operator $O_{8g}$, applying the method of LCSRs with $ B$-meson distribution amplitudes. We compute, both analytically and numerically, the operator-product expansion (OPE) diagrams with hard-gluon exchanges, analyse their structure and hierarchy, and obtain their spectral density entering the LCSR together with soft-gluon contributions.

Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity.

Instead, neutrino scattering experiments (such as COHERENT), astrophysical sources (supernova emission), and cosmology ($ΔN_{\\rm eff}$) provide the strongest constraints due to the nonzero couplings of the chargephobic vector boson to neutrinos and neutrons. Indeed, we find that supernova emission and $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$ provide constraints throughout the space of dark mixing angles, demonstrating their importance to provide model-independent constraints. For nearly all of the parameter space, a chargephobic vector boson is the most weakly constrained anomaly-free vector boson that couples to flavor-independent or flavor-dependent combinations of Standard Model currents. Finally, we highlight the importance of future experiments, including SHiP, that are able to probe new regions of the chargephobic parameter space due to the significantly improved detector capabilities."}

However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field."}

We examine nucleation seeded by preexisting domain walls and demonstrate its strong impact on the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions. The bubble solutions take the form of spherical caps, and the contact angle is fixed by the ratio of the domain-wall tension to the bubble-wall tension. A larger domain-wall tension, or equivalently a smaller contact angle, reduces the wall-seeded bubble volume and lowers the critical nucleation action. For theories with $\\mathbb{Z}_{n\\geq 3}$ symmetry, domain-wall junctions naturally appear and we find that they seed nucleation even more efficiently than the walls themselves. Using a two-scalar-field model as an illustration, we compute nucleation temperatures for both homogeneous and heterogeneous channels and show that junction-seeded nucleation occurs at a higher temperature and is the dominant mechanism that completes the first-order cosmological phase transition."}

Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions."}
