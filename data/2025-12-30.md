### [1] [Temperature Dependence of the Masses of Various Meson States: A Comparative Study in SU(3) and SU(4) extended Linear-Sigma Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22198)

TL;DR: 本文使用扩展线性西格玛模型（eLSM）研究介子质量。研究表明，包含更多夸克类型（SU(4)）的模型比（SU(3)）模型更准确。此外，研究还发现，尽管不同介子在升温时质量变化各异，但它们大多在相似的温度下分解，而夸克偶素则对温度不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究介子的手征相变结构，并探讨夸克自由度的增加（从SU(3)到SU(4)的比较）以及温度变化对不同介子（赝标量、标量、矢量、轴矢量）质量的影响。

Method: 该研究采用了扩展线性西格玛模型（eLSM），并在平均场近似下进行分析。研究人员系统地比较了SU(3)和SU(4)两种配置下的介子质量。

Result: 研究发现，SU(4) eLSM模型对介子质量的估算比SU(3) eLSM更接近实验值。在温度效应方面，虽然不同介子质量随温度变化的模式各不相同，但它们似乎都在一个相似的解离温度范围内分解。特别地，夸克偶素状态的质量基本上不受温度变化的影响。

Conclusion: 增加夸克自由度（从SU(3)到SU(4)）能显著提高介子质量模拟的准确性。研究发现，从强子到夸克的相变临界温度会因介子状态的不同而略有差异，其中由夸克和其反夸克组成的夸克偶素状态尤其稳定，基本不受温度变化的影响。

Abstract: In the extended Linear-Sigma Model (eLSM), the chiral phase structure of meson states, including pseudoscalars ($J^{pc}=0^{-+}$), scalars ($J^{pc}=0^{++}$), vectors ($J^{pc}=1^{--}$), and axial-vectors ($J^{pc}=1^{++}$), is investigated with the mean-field approximation. A systematic comparison between SU(3) and SU(4) configurations is provided. It has been found that the estimations of meson masses derived from SU(4) eLSM are more congruent with experimental values than those derived from SU(3) eLSM. Consequently, we conclude that an increase in quark degrees of freedom significantly enhances the accuracy of meson mass simulations. We investigate the effect of temperature on the masses of various meson states calculated in the SU(3) and SU(4) eLSM. After establishing all the fitting parameters, the temperature dependence of meson masses shows that although various meson states exhibit unique patterns in their mass changes with temperature, they all seem to share a similar range of dissolution temperatures. This means that the critical temperature that marks the phase transition from hadrons to quarks appears to vary slightly depending on the meson states. In this regard, we find that the quarkonium states, formed by a quark and its antiquark, are largely unaffected by variations in the temperature.

### [2] [Gravitational waves from seesaw assisted collapsing domain walls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22339)
*Debasish Borah,Indrajit Saha*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种理论，利用I型跷跷板模型中的重右手中微子来解决宇宙学中的畴壁问题，该过程会产生可被探测的引力波，并有可能解释宇宙物质的起源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在宇宙学中，离散对称性（如Z2）的自发破缺会形成稳定的畴壁，这与现有观测数据可能存在矛盾。因此，需要一种机制来消除这些畴壁。

Method: 论文研究了通过引入一个显式的Z2对称性破缺“偏置项”来促使畴壁湮灭。作者提出，这个偏置项可以由I型跷跷板模型中的重右手中微子通过量子修正自然产生。

Result: 该机制的引入建立了一个跷跷板模型能标、引力波峰值振幅和频率之间的直接关联。这种关联为通过引力波实验和宇宙微波背景（CMB）的精确测量来探测新物理提供了可能。此外，在特定对称性假设下，该模型还能解释宇宙中物质-反物质不对称的起源。

Conclusion: 该模型巧妙地将中微子质量起源（跷跷板机制）、宇宙学畴壁问题、可观测的引力波以及宇宙的重子不对称性（通过共振轻子生成）联系在一起，构建了一个具有很强可检验性的理论框架。

Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries like $Z_2$ leads to the formation of stable topological defects such as domain walls which, if allowed to dominate, can potentially be in conflict with cosmological observations. Incorporating explicit $Z_2$-breaking bias terms can lead to annihilation of such walls while also emitting stochastic gravitational wave (GW). We study the role of heavy right-handed neutrinos present in type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino masses to generate such bias term via quantum corrections. This offers interesting correlation among the seesaw scale, GW peak amplitude and peak frequency which can be probed at present and future experiments related to GW as well as precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In flavor symmetric UV complete scenarios with degenerate RHNs at leading order, such tiny coupling of RHNs to a $Z_2$-odd scalar can also lead to small mass splittings suitable for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via resonant leptogenesis.

### [3] [Minimal A4 Type-II Seesaw Realization of Testable Neutrino Mass Sum Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22343)
*Salvador Centelles Chuliá,Ranjeet Kumar*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 研究者提出了一个基于A4对称性和II型跷跷板机制的味模型。该模型不仅可以确定中微子的绝对质量谱，还对轻子混合、无中微子双贝塔衰变以及特定粒子衰变模式做出了一系列紧密关联且可供实验检验的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的粒子物理标准模型无法完全解释中微子的质量和混合现象，需要构建新的、具有高度约束性和可检验性的理论模型来解释这些观测结果，并将其与其他物理现象相关联。

Method: 该模型基于A4对称性，并结合了II型跷跷板机制来生成中微子质量。

Result: 该模型产生的中微子质量矩阵遵循一个求和规则，从而确定了绝对中微子质量谱；模型预测了反转的质量顺序，并对轻子混合参数和马约拉纳相(Majorana phases)给出了具体的预测和限制；它还预测了无中微子双贝塔衰变率会接近其最大值，同时在带电轻子部分，μ子的味破坏过程受到抑制，而特定的τ子衰变通道则被允许。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个约束性强且可通过实验验证的理论框架，它成功地将中微子质量、轻子混合以及轻子数破坏等可观测现象紧密联系在一起。

Abstract: We propose a flavour model based on an $A_4$ symmetry combined with a type-II seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. The resulting neutrino mass matrix obeys a sum rule that, together with the measured mass-squared differences, fully determines the absolute neutrino mass spectrum. The constrained flavour structure yields correlated predictions for lepton mixing parameters, leads to inverted ordering after imposing mixing constraints, restricts the Majorana phases and implies a neutrinoless double beta decay rate close to its maximal value for inverted ordering. In the charged lepton sector an approximate triality symmetry arises in the seesaw limit, suppressing muon flavour-violating processes and allowing only specific $τ$ decay channels. The model provides a tightly constrained and experimentally testable framework linking neutrino masses, lepton mixing and lepton-number-violating observables.

### [4] [Can high-$p_\perp$ theory and data constrain $η/s$?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22358)

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 该论文使用高横向动量粒子的能量损失来更好地约束夸克-胶子等离子体的比剪切粘度（η/s）随温度的变化，因为传统的低动量方法效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解特定剪切粘度（η/s）对温度的依赖性对于描述在超相对论重离子碰撞中产生的夸克-胶子等离子体（QCD 物质）的性质至关重要。然而，现有的低横向动量（low-p⊥）理论和数据对 η/s(T) 的形式不敏感，特别是在高温下。

Method: 本文提出使用高横向动量（high-p⊥）的数据和理论来施加额外的约束。该方法基于对穿过夸克-胶子等离子体的高动量粒子的动态辐射和碰撞能量损失进行建模分析。

Result: 基于高动量粒子能量损失的方法在约束 η/s 的温度依赖性方面取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 利用高横向动量粒子的能量损失是一种有效的方法，可以为夸克-胶子等离子体中随温度变化的特定剪切粘度（η/s）施加更强的约束，从而克服低动量观测的局限性。

Abstract: Understanding the temperature dependence of the specific shear viscosity $(η/s)$ is crucial for characterizing the properties of the QCD matter produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Since, low-$p_\perp$ theory and data are only weakly sensitive to the typical forms of $η/s(T)$, especially at high temperatures, we use high-$p_\perp$ data and theory to impose additional constraints on it. Our approach, based on dynamical radiative and collisional energy loss of high-$p_\perp$ particles, provides promising results in constraining the temperature dependence of $η/s$.

### [5] [Orbital angular momentum in the pion and kaon: rest-frame and light-front](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22359)
*Y. -Y. Xiao,Z. -N. Xu,Z. -Q. Yao,C. D. Roberts,J. Rodríguez-Quintero*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了强子（如π介子和K介子）内部的轨道角动量（OAM）。研究发现，尽管OAM的测量值依赖于观测者，但强子本身含有显著的、不依赖于参考系的内在OAM，这对其结构和可观测性质有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨道角动量（OAM）的值依赖于观测者，这与量子色动力学（QCD）理论的庞加莱不变性存在看似矛盾之处。本文旨在阐明OAM在强子内部的主观特性及其对物理结构的影响。

Method: 本文使用了连续谱施温格函数方法（continuum Schwinger function methods），并分析了π介子和K介子的Bethe-Salpeter波函数的光前投影（light-front projections）。

Result: 研究发现，π介子大约是光前轨道角动量（OAM）为0和为1的成分各占50%的混合态，而K介子中这两者的比例约为60/40。这表明，（近）南部-戈德斯通模式的粒子是具有显著内在OAM的复杂束缚态。

Conclusion: 所有强子都是复杂的束缚态，拥有显著的、不随观测者参考系改变的内在轨道角动量。这一特性在计算物理可观测量时必须被考虑进去。从π介子和K介子的结果可以推断，这个结论适用于所有强子。

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is not a Poincaré invariant quantity; so, its value is observer dependent. Notwithstanding that, in quantum chromodynamics, a Poincaré-invariant theory, OAM is part of every hadron wave function. Using continuum Schwinger function methods, we elucidate both the subjective character of in-hadron OAM and expose some of its impacts on pion and kaon structure and observables. For instance, working with light-front projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions, it is found that the pion is a roughly 50/50 mix of light-front OAM zero and one components and the kaon is a 60/40 system. The overall picture is that (near) Nambu-Goldstone modes are complex bound states, each with significant intrinsic OAM, independent of the observer's reference frame. This feature must be accounted for in the calculation of observables. Inductively, the same is true for all hadrons.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了重离子碰撞初期，非平衡夸克-胶子等离子体（QGP）对射流的改变，并通过改进 QCD 动理论模拟，为理解这一过程提供了更真实的模型和新的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对于重离子碰撞初期射流与介质相互作用的理解尚不充分，需要通过更真实的模型来描述这一非平衡过程。

Method: 1. 计算了预平衡阶段的射流淬火参数 (jet quenching parameter, q̂) 和弹性碰撞核。

3. 使用非平衡各向异性碰撞核研究了胶子分裂率。
4. 通过外推至零耦合，识别出一种新型的弱耦合吸引子。

Result: 1. 预平衡阶段的射流淬火参数值与早期的 Glasma 阶段相当。
2. 改进的屏蔽机制显著降低了等离子体的最大各向异性和比剪切粘度 (η/s)。
3. 使用各向异性核计算出的胶子分裂率，在数值大小和时间演化上都与传统模型有显著差异。
4. 发现了存在于射流淬火参数与压力比中的一种新型弱耦合吸引子。

Conclusion: 这项工作改进了动力学理论描述并发现了新的吸引子，为更真实地模拟重离子碰撞早期的非平衡态夸克-胶子等离子体（QGP）及其演化过程做出了贡献。

Abstract: This thesis focuses on how jets are modified by the nonequilibrium quark-gluon plasma during the initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Its influence on their propagation is typically encoded in a single medium function, the dipole cross section. Its small distance behavior is characterized by the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$, and we obtain its numerical value throughout the pre-equilibrium stage, finding values comparable in magnitude to the earlier Glasma stage. We also compute the more general elastic collision kernel, obtained by Fourier transforming the dipole cross section. This constitutes an important step to facilitate the understanding of jet-medium interactions during the initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Additionally, we improve QCD kinetic theory simulations by employing a more realistic (HTL) screening mechanism to incorporate medium effects, which we compare with simpler screening mechanisms. An expanding plasma realized in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions exhibits a significantly reduced maximum anisotropy and reduced specific shear viscosity $η/s$ when using the improved screening prescription. Moreover, we investigate the gluon splitting rates, which are typically obtained using an isotropic model for the collision kernel. Going beyond that approximation, we find that the splitting rates obtained from the nonequilibrium anisotropic kernel differ significantly both in magnitude and in their qualitative time evolution. We further identify a novel type of weak-coupling attractor, which can be observed in the ratio of the jet quenching parameter and pressure ratio, and is obtained by extrapolating to vanishing coupling. This improved kinetic theory description and novel limiting attractors contribute towards a more realistic modeling of the nonequilibrium QCD plasma and its equilibration and hydrodynamization process during the initial stages.

Abstract: Black hole relics are of significant interest in cosmology and theoretical physics. In this work, we consider tiny primordial black holes (PBHs) ( $M_{\text {PBH }} \lesssim 10^7 \mathrm{~g}$ ) which are generated soon after the end of inflation and evaporate and reheat the Universe before big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), but leave their remnants due to incomplete evaporation. These PBHs remnants may contribute as part or all of the dark matter (DM) today. Assuming that there exist PBH relics, we point out that the number density of PBH today can be directly read from the peak positions of the induced gravitational waves due to the inhomogeneous PBH distribution. If PBH relics are of Planck mass and they forms all the DM today, the PBH number density would be of $10^{-25} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ with the peak frequency 60 Hz . The peak frequency scales as $f_{\text {relic }}^{1 / 3}$ where $f_{\text {relic }}$ is the fraction of the PBH relics in the total DM density. The peak amplitude carries the information of initial PBH abundance. For monochromatic-mass PBH with the current number density $10^{-41} \sim 10^{-25} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and initial abundance $10^{-13} \sim 10^{-7}$, the amplitude may be large enough to be detected by planned gravitational wave experiments in the near future.

Abstract: We discuss the quantum mechanics of coalescence of quark-antiquark pairs into mesons using a non-relativistic quark model. We derive the coalescence probabilities assuming a harmonic oscillator potential and generic Gaussian wave packet shapes for the initial quarks and antiquarks. Our particular emphasis is on modeling excited states of the meson spectrum consistently. We provide the formalism to systematically include excited states from the Particle Data Book, and many more predicted by the quark model, up to $L=4$ and masses of about 2.2 GeV for light flavors. We provide estimates of masses and decay branching ratios for unconfirmed states. We use a phase space picture which is appropriate for the quasi-classical nature of the information typically available for the quarks and antiquarks in applications like Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that for typical parton configurations expected in jets, excited meson states are populated abundantly.

Abstract: This work explores the discovery potential of the first-generation weak isosinglet Vector-Like Leptons (VLLs), denoted by $E^\pm$, via pair production at future electron-positron colliders. Our analysis adopts a comprehensive framework that incorporates beam polarization configurations and leverages detailed detector simulations. We focus on two distinct multilepton signatures: the $2\ell + 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ and $3\ell + 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ final states ($\ell = e, μ$). Both signatures arise from the decay $E^{\pm} \to Z e^{\pm} / W^{\pm} ν_\ell$ and are distinguished by the decay patterns of the associated gauge bosons. By applying optimized selection criteria to both signal and background events, we establish exclusion sensitivities and discovery prospects across the VLL mass spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that, for integrated luminosities of $\SI{25}{fb^{-1}}$, $\SI{90}{fb^{-1}}$ and $\SI{1000}{fb^{-1}}$ at corresponding center-of-mass (c.m.) energies of $\SI{1}{TeV}$, $\SI{1.5}{TeV}$ and $\SI{3}{TeV}$, the accessible mass range extends to approximately $\SI{490}{GeV}$, $\SI{740}{GeV}$ and $\SI{1440}{GeV}$, which represents a substantially improvement over the detection limits of existing hadron collider experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We construct a classically scale invariant version of the Zee-Babu model governed by an $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry wherein three right handed neutrinos with identical gauge charges are present. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is additionally imposed such that the lightest right handed neutrino becomes a dark matter candidate. A spontaneous breakdown of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group is triggered radiatively through renormalisation group effects and the dimensionful parameters thus emerging are proportional to the corresponding breaking scale $v_{BL}$. We demonstrate in this study how the same $v_{BL}$ controls the dynamics of neutrino mass generation, lepton flavour violation and dark matter phenomenology. It is revealed that the scenario can simultaneously accommodate the observed neutrino masses and mixings, an appropriately low lepton flavour violation and the observed dark matter relic density for 10 TeV $\lesssim v_{BL} \lesssim$ 55 TeV. In addition, the very radiative nature of the set-up signals a strong first order phase transition in the presence of a non-zero temperature. Stochastic gravitational waves stemming from this phase transition are within the reach of detectors such as LISA and BBO. The scenario therefore emerges as a concrete platform to test classical scale invariance that is tied to neutrino masses and dark matter, through gravitational waves.

Abstract: We have conducted a study of the $B^{+(0)} \to \bar D^{0(-)} D^{*}_{s0}(2317)^+$ reactions from the perspective that the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance is a molecular state of the $KD$ and $D_s η$ components. We have followed a method to evaluate the branching fractions obtaining information from the experimental data on the $B^+\to \bar D^0 K^+ D^0$, $B^+\to \bar D^0 K^0 D^+$, $B^0 \to D^- K^+ D^0$, $B^0 \to D^- K^0 D^+$ reactions, which have the $D^0 K^+$ and $D^+ K^0$ pairs in the final state. The approach concentrates the dynamics of the weak process in the branching ratios of these reactions and pays attention to the propagation of the $DK$ components and their strong interaction to form the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance. We find branching ratios for the $B^{+(0)} \to \bar D^{0(-)} D^{*}_{s0}(2317)^+$ reactions, which are compatible with the experimental data, but considering errors there is room for contributions of other nonmolecular components, although a sizeable fraction from the molecular components is a solid conclusion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The neutral-current (NC) non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with fermions can modify the flavor oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos as they propagate through the Earth. We present constraints on the NC-NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{μτ}$ and $\varepsilon_{ττ}-\varepsilon_{μμ}$ (one at a time) using a high-purity sample of $ν_μ$ charged-current (CC) atmospheric neutrino events collected by IceCube DeepCore over 7.5 years of livetime. These two parameters significantly affect the $ν_μ$ disappearance channel for which this golden event sample is optimized by the IceCube Collaboration. The best fit to this dataset is consistent with no NSI hypothesis, and we place the most stringent constraints to date: $-\,0.0094 < \varepsilon_{μτ} < 0.0079$ and $-\,0.030 < \varepsilon_{ττ}-\varepsilon_{μμ} < 0.029$ at 90% confidence level.

Abstract: We present a generalization of the $x$-space $\texttt{Candia}$ algorithm to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) accuracy in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for solving the DGLAP evolution equations for unpolarized parton densities in the nucleon. The algorithm is based on logarithmic expansions of the solution and can be extended to all orders in QCD. An expansion equivalent to the exact solution of the DGLAP equation at N$^3$LO is presented in the non-singlet sector. Results for approximate N$^3$LO PDFs, evolved using the most recent approximations to the N$^3$LO DGLAP splitting functions, are provided for benchmarking.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the prospects for observing lepton number violation (LNV) by two units, $|ΔL| = 2$, at the LHC within the leptoquark variant of the Zee Model, where Majorana neutrino masses arise radiatively at one-loop. The model features an $SU(2)_L$ doublet and singlet leptoquarks, whose interactions produce a distinctive same-sign dilepton plus jets signature, $pp \to \ell^{\pm}\ell'^{\pm} + \text{jets}$. Taking into account current experimental constraints, we identify the dominant production channels for this LNV signal and perform a detailed collider analysis. We find that the HL-LHC can probe leptoquark masses up to $m_{\rm LQ} \sim 1.5~\mathrm{TeV}$ with this process. Observation of this signal would provide a direct test of LNV and would unambiguously establish the Majorana nature of neutrinos.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effective parameter space associated with the axion mass and the axion decay constant in both the light and heavy QCD axion scenarios. We initiate our discussion by considering the simplest case of two axions, quantitatively analyzing the parameter space in these two distinct scenarios. We find that the axion mass ratios exhibit a high degree of similarity in these two situations. In contrast, the ratios of axion decay constants display a complete opposition. Furthermore, we generalize our conclusions to encompass the case of multiple axions.

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of Bell nonlocality and entanglement in $χ_{cJ}$ decays into baryon pair ($B\bar{B}$) ($J=0,1,2$). From the baryon-antibaryon spin density matrix, we construct measurable Bell observables and concurrence, revealing a striking hierarchy of quantum correlations: $χ_{c0}$ decays exhibit maximal violation and entanglement; $χ_{c1}$ decays violate Bell inequalities for $θ_1 \in (0, π)$ with angle-modulated strength; we find that $B\bar B$ in $χ_{c2}$ decays is in separable state, and no indication is found for the Bell inequality violation. We provide complete analytical results for $J=0,1$ and quantitative, uncertainty-aware estimations for $J=2$ using experimental inputs. The results indicates that the $χ_{cJ}$ system as a novel platform for testing quantum entanglement in high-energy collisions.

Abstract: Lorentz invariance (LI) is a foundational principle of modern physics, yet its possible violation (LIV) remains an intriguing window to physics beyond the Standard Model. While stringent constraints exist in the electromagnetic and hadronic sectors, the weak sector-particularly unstable bosons-remains largely unexplored. In this work, based on our recent studies and conference presentation, we analyze how LIV manifests in high-energy collider experiments, focusing on modifications of Z boson dispersion relations and their impact on resonance measurements in Drell--Yan processes. We argue that precision measurements of resonance masses at colliders provide sensitivity to LIV at the level of $10^{-9}$, comparable to bounds derived from cosmic rays. We also discuss the interplay between LIV and gauge invariance, highlighting why only specific operators provide physical effects. The phenomenological implications for both Z and W bosons are outlined, with emphasis on experimental strategies for current and future colliders.

Abstract: We present a fully differential computation of $e^+\,e^-\toγ\,γ$ at next-to-next-to-leading order in QED. The process has been implemented into McMule, completing its set of next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations for the most important $2 \to 2$ processes. The results allow for generic applications to electron-positron colliders with centre-of-mass energies up to a few GeV, particularly for luminosity measurements.

Abstract: The possible anomalous New Physics contributions to dipole and weak dipole moments of the $τ$ lepton bring renewed interest in development and revisiting charge-parity violating signatures in $τ$-pair production in $Z$-boson decay at energies of the LHC. In this paper, we discuss effects of anomalous contributions to polarisation and spin correlations in the $\bar q q \to τ^+ τ^-$ production processes, with $τ$ decays included. Because of the complex nature of the resulting distributions, Monte Carlo techniques are useful, in particular of event reweighing with studied New Physics phenomena. Extensions of the Standard Model spin amplitudes, within Improved Born Approximation used for matrix element, are implemented in the TauSpinner program. This is mainly with $τ$ dipole and weak dipole moments in mind, but is applicable to arbitrary New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into the Standard Model $2 \to 2$ structure of matrix element extensions. Implementation allows one also to introduce arbitrary phase-shift between vector and axial-vector couplings of $Z$ boson to $τ$ leptons, which would have impact on observed transverse spin correlations. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, together with distributions for spin correlation matrix. Numerical examples of impact on experimental signatures are shown in case of $τ^\pm \to ρ^\pm ν_τ\to π^\pm π^0 ν_τ$ decays. Information on how to use and configure the TauSpinner program is given in Appendix.

Abstract: We present the analytic results for the non-singlet contributions to the three-loop mixed strong-electroweak ${\mathcal{O}}(α_s^2α)$ virtual corrections to the quark form factors. The primary challenge of this computation arises from the presence of massive vector bosons within the loops. This significantly increases the complexity of the integration-by-parts reduction of the scalar integrals and complicates their evaluation via the method of differential equations. To obtain the physical results, we perform the appropriate ultraviolet renormalization and subtract the universal infrared divergences. The resulting finite remainders are expressed in terms of Harmonic Polylogarithms and Generalized Polylogarithms.

Abstract: We revisit the total decay rate of a muon being in the ground state of a Coulomb potential with atomic charge numbers $4\leq Z \leq 9$. The discrepancy between the perturbative $(αZ)^2$ result of [Phys. Rev. \textbf{119}, 365 (1960)] and the fully relativistic partial-wave calculation of [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables \textbf{54}, 165 (1993)] for oxygen ($Z=8$) is shown to originate from insufficient convergence of the partial-wave series in the latter work. Our accurate relativistic calculations restore agreement with the perturbative $αZ$~expansion and indicate a negative sign for the next-order $(αZ)^3$ correction.

Abstract: Hadronic molecules $\mathfrak{M}=J/ψB_{c}^{+}$ and $\widetilde{\mathfrak{ M}}=η_{c}B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are investigated in the framework of QCD sum rule method. These particles with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{P}}=1^+$ have the quark contents $cc \overline{c}\overline{b}$. We compute their masses and current couplings and find that they are numerically very close to each other. Because it is difficult to distinguish reliably the molecules $J/ψB_{c}^{+}$ and $J/ψB_{c}^{+}$, we treat them as identical structures, and consider in details the state $\mathfrak{M}$. Our prediction $m=(9740 \pm 70)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for its mass means that $\mathfrak{M}$ easily decays to pairs of ordinary mesons through strong interactions. There are two mechanisms responsible for transformations of $\mathfrak{M}$ to conventional mesons. The fall-apart mechanism generates the dominant decay channels $ \mathfrak{M} \to J/ψB_{c}^{+}$ and $\mathfrak{M} \to η_{c}B_{c}^{\ast +}$. Annihilation of $\overline{c}c$ quarks triggers subdominant processes with various final-state $B$ and $D$ mesons: Six of such channels are explored in this work. The partial widths of all decays are computed using the three-point sum rule approach. The width $Γ[ \mathfrak{M}]=(121 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the hadronic axial-vector molecule $\mathfrak{M}$, as well as its mass are valuable for running and future experiments.

Abstract: We investigate the concept of partonic entropy of the proton within the Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi (DGLAP) evolution scheme of collinear parton distributions. We show that such entropy increases monotonically with the evolution scale. The mechanism underlying this growth is illustrated using a simplified model of DGLAP evolution, which highlights the importance of including saturation effects at small $x$ in the evolution of parton distributions. Based on existing literature, we present two simplified models of parton saturation at small $x$. In one of these models, partonic entropy is identified with entanglement entropy and proposed as an observable to be tested experimentally.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the spacelike region by combining three complementary approaches: two GPD-based contributions and a vector-meson exchange component. By fitting experimental data, we extract the optimal weights and shape parameters describing the proton and neutron form factors. Global Padé-based fits are then constructed for four distinct groups of form factors, starting from local Taylor expansions and yielding stable analytic parametrizations over the analyzed $t$ range. The combined framework provides an accurate and physically motivated description of nucleon structure within a controlled model-dependent setting across a wide range of momentum transfers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study heavy photophobic axion-like particles (ALPs) in the limit of an effectively vanishing diphoton coupling, $g_{aγγ}\simeq 0$, for which diphoton production and decay are suppressed and collider phenomenology is driven by electroweak interactions ($aWW$, $aZγ$, $aZZ$). We perform detector-level searches at a future $\sqrt{s}=$ 100 TeV $pp$ collider (SppC/FCC-hh), with an integrated luminosity of $L =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$. We consider $a\to Zγ$ and $a\to W^+W^-$ decays. For $pp\to jj\,a$ we include both $s$-channel electroweak exchange and vector boson fusion (VBF)-like topologies, while the tri-$W$ signature arises from associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ (via $s$-channel exchange) followed by $a\to W^+W^-$. We analyze three final states--$Zγjj$ with $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$, tri-$W$ ($W^\pm W^\pm W^\mp$) with same-sign dimuons plus jets, and $W^+W^-jj$ with opposite-sign, different-flavor dilepton ($e^\pmμ^\mp$) plus jets. A boosted-decision-tree (BDT) classifier built from kinematic observables provides the final signal--background separation. At $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV and $L =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$, we present discovery sensitivities to the ALP--$W$ coupling $g_{aWW}$ over $m_a\in[100,\,7000]$ GeV. In parallel, we report model-independent discovery thresholds on $σ\times\mathrm{Br}$ for $pp\to jj\,a$ with $a\to Zγ$ and $a\to W^+W^-$, as well as for associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ with $a\to W^+W^-$. Taken together, the three channels deliver broad coverage and mutually reinforcing checks across decay modes and production regimes, strengthening robustness against channel-dependent systematics. The 100~TeV program extends the discovery reach well beyond 14~TeV projections within a general effective field theory (EFT) description that does not assume a specific ultraviolet completion.

Abstract: We explore phenomenological constraints on, and future muon collider sensitivities to, the parameter spaces of various muonphilic portals to fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM). Both WEFT-level dimension-6 effective operators and two UV models based on gauged $L_μ- L_τ$ are considered. One of the latter features a vector coupling to the dark matter and the other an axial vector coupling. The ADM criterion that at least $99\%$ of the dark matter relic density is asymmetric is also imposed. We identify which of these scenarios are currently allowed by direct detection and collider constraints, and then determine how much more of the parameter space could be probed by 3 and 10 TeV muon colliders with 1 ab$^{-1}$ of data. For the UV models, the constraints from $g-2$ of the muon are included. The future sensitivity curves due to neutron star heating considerations are also depicted. We present results for both the few-GeV dark matter mass regime motivated by ADM approaches to the $Ω_b \simeq Ω_\text{DM}/5$ coincidence problem, and for larger masses in the context of more general ADM.

Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a systematic framework to probe indirect effects of heavy new physics via precision measurements. While SMEFT constraints have been extensively studied using purely leptonic $Z$ decays and inclusive $Z$ production, mixed leptonic-hadronic modes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze $Z \to μμbb$ decays within the SMEFT framework, deriving constraints on dimension-six operators that affect four-fermion interactions between leptons and bottom quarks, as well as $Z$-fermion couplings. Signal and background events are simulated with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tools, including detector effects such as $b$-tagging, and limits on the relevant Wilson coefficients are extracted using kinematic distributions and a profile likelihood approach. Our results provide complementary constraints to existing SMEFT studies and yield the first process-specific limits on flavor-resolved four-fermion operators involving muons and bottom quarks from $Z$ decays.

Abstract: The increasingly stringent bounds on the Higgs-portal coupling, arising from dark matter (DM) direct-detection searches, confront the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM scenario with thermal production, where freeze-out occurs in the standard radiation-dominated era. This limitation can be alleviated by introducing a dimension-5 Higgs-portal operator in the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM model and/or by modifying the standard cosmological history of the Universe. In this article, we analyze complex scalar DM production in both the reheating and radiation-dominated epochs within an effective field theory (EFT) framework. While both scenarios exhibit sizeable regions of parameter space consistent with existing constraints, freeze-out during reheating opens up additional viable regions that are otherwise ruled out by DM overabundance in the radiation-dominated scenario. Notably, the renormalizable Higgs-portal coupling is constrained by relic density, direct- and indirect-detection limits, whereas the EFT coupling associated with the dimension-5 operator is constrained by relic density and indirect-detection bounds arising from DM semi-annihilation. We further study the production cross section of complex scalar DM at hadron and lepton colliders.

Abstract: Two-photon collision in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) provides a unique and powerful platform for probing QCD with linearly polarized quasi-real photons. While photon polarization effects have been recognized in dilepton and even in light hadrons production, their consequences for heavy quarkonium production remain unexplored. In this work we investigate for the first time the $γγ\to J/ψ+γ(J/ψ)$ channels in Pb-Pb UPCs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), by integrating the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization approach with the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) photon distributions. Based on the helicity amplitudes at lowest order in strong coupling and velocity expansion, we predict sizable $\cos(2φ)$ and $\cos(4φ)$ azimuthal asymmetries arising from the interference of linearly polarized photon states. These azimuthal-dependent observables, defined as the ratios of weighted to unweighted cross sections, are expected to be stable against including the higher-order radiative corrections and varying nonperturbative NRQCD matrix elements, thus offering a fresh test of quarkonium production mechanism and the photon TMD structure in the ultrarelativistic limit.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Higgs boson decay channels, specifically, $h{\rightarrow}γγ$, $h{\rightarrow} VV^*$ (with $V=Z,W$), and $h{\rightarrow} f\bar{f}$ (for $f=b,c,τ$) within the flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model (FDM). We also investigate processes induced by flavor-changing neutral currents, including the decays $\bar B \to X_sγ$ and $B_s^0 \to μ^+μ^-$, the top quark decays $t\to c h$ and $t\to u h$, and the lepton flavor-violating decays $τ\to 3e$, $τ\to 3μ$, and $μ\to 3e$. Furthermore, we incorporate the electroweak precision observables constraints via the S, T, and U parameters. Compared to the Standard Model, the scalar sector of the FDM is extended by two Higgs doublets and one Higgs singlet, which affects the 125 GeV Higgs properties significantly. Meanwhile, the decays $h{\rightarrow} Zγ$, $h\rightarrow MZ$, and $h{\rightarrow} Mγ$ (where $M$ is a vector meson $(ρ,ω,φ,J/Ψ,Υ)$ of the Standard-Model-like Higgs are studied, and we illustrate how changes in the scalar sector and the Yukawa coupling influence the signal strengths for the 125 GeV Higgs decay channels and the Higgs mass in the FDM.

Abstract: Recent experimental data from MINERvA on transverse kinematics observables across four different nuclear targets - carbon, oxygen, iron, and lead - have been utilized to refine the modeling of final state interaction effects in the NuWro Monte Carlo neutrino event generator. For this purpose, we have developed an event reweighting tool for future applications to adjust the strength of final-state interactions. This study highlights the requirement for stronger nucleon reinteractions than previously assumed, but it still falls within the uncertainty range observed in a study comparing proton transparency measurements. This conclusion has significant implications for both experimental and theoretical work involving NuWro.

Abstract: The search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider is expanding to include unconventional signatures such as long-lived particles. This mini-review assesses the prospects for detecting electrically charged long-lived particles using the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment. We synthesize findings from recent studies that evaluate sensitivity to supersymmetric models, radiative neutrino mass scenarios, and generic multiply charged objects. A key component of this review is the comparative analysis of MoEDAL's reach against the general-purpose ATLAS and CMS experiments. We conclude that while MoEDAL is constrained by lower integrated luminosity, its passive, background-free detection methodology offers a unique advantage. Specifically, the experiment provides complementarity to the major detectors, particularly for signals involving slow-moving particles and stable states with intermediate electric charges.

Abstract: We compute the soft function at NLO and NNLO for a one-parameter family of event shapes we call C-angularity. This family contains C-parameter as a specific choice of the parameter, in close analogy with how conventional angularity contains thrust as a special case. By construction, C-angularity and angularity coincide in the collinear limit such that the anomalous dimensions are equal. However, unlike angularity, C-angularity is a continuously differentiable function of the final state momenta, which makes the analytic calculation of the C-angularity soft function simpler. We obtain analytical results for the C-angularity soft function and anomalous dimension as an expansion in the C-angularity parameter $a$, to third and fourth order in $a$ respectively. These expansions yield results that are accurate at the few per mille level for $-1\le a < 1$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of 2 Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) with a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, $U(1)_X$, by which flavor changing neutral currents are forbidden at tree level. As an important consequence of the spontaneous breaking of both the $U(1)_X$ and electroweak symmetries by electroweak vacuum expectation values, upper limits appear on masses of an additional gauge boson $Z'$ and extra Higgs bosons which are less than the TeV scale. In addition, the standard model (SM) like Higgs boson $h$ and a heavier Higgs boson $H$ mainly decay into a pair of $Z'$ which induces four lepton final states. These new decay modes cannot be suppressed by taking no $Z$-$Z'$ mixing and/or the Higgs alignment limit. We find that the minimum setup of these 2HDMs has been excluded by current data for four lepton searches at LHC. Such severe constraints can, however, be avoided by introducing a pair of vector-like fermions $χ$ which are singlet under the SM symmetry but charged under $U(1)_X$, and can be a candidate of dark matter. Thanks to the existence of $χ$, $Z'$ can mainly decay into $χ\barχ$ instead of SM leptons. As benchmark models, we consider the $U(1)_H$ and $U(1)_R$ models realized by fixing specific $U(1)_X$ charges, and find regions of parameter space allowed by theoretical and current experimental constraints. We clarify that $m_H \in [160, 220]$ GeV and $\tan β\in [3, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)_H$ model, while $m_H \in [160, 380]$ GeV and $\tan β\in [1.6, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)_R$ model. In both the models, the $Z'$ mass is constrained to be $100~\text{GeV} \lesssim m_{Z'} \lesssim 110$ GeV. Such a quite limited parameter space can further be explored at future collider experiments, e.g., High-Luminosity LHC and lepton colliders.

Abstract: We briefly review false-vacuum decay and examine a recent proposal by Frampton to model the origin of the first single-celled organism (SCO) as a phase transition between no-life and life vacua. In his calculation the exponent $n$ entering the probability $P_{\rm SCO}\sim 10^{-n}$ has dimensions of inverse time: it is an energy barrier divided by the Planck constant, rather than a dimensionless tunnelling action. The resulting probability is mathematically ill-defined and does not determine a tunnelling rate. Apart from this dimensional issue, the assumed initial configuration, a toroidal structure made of long molecules, and its treatment in empty space are inconsistent with soft-matter physics and with the hot, collisional environment expected for prebiotic chemistry. Consequently, the claimed exponential suppression of biogenesis, and the inference that extraterrestrial life is likely absent, are not supported.

Abstract: From the perspective of low energy tau decays and radiative corrections in decays, not much has changed since the last, Tau23 conference. Also, TAUOLA, tau decay library, and PHOTOS for radiative corrections in decays have not changed much, neither for QED nor for New Physics processes application. Progress was in the domain of flexibilities for applications and in the domain of New Physicists. There was progress with use of exclusive exponentiation (KKMC Monte Carlo) to evaluate quality of tau pair formation and decay factorization, with Collins-Soper and Mustraal frames. Ambiguities for New Physics or other processes could be thus addressed. Associated projects of KKMC f77 and KKMCee C++, are presented: (i) pi+ pi- pair production at Belle II energies, interesting input for Pi_gammagamma(s), (ii) attribution of helicity like labels for taus in simulated HepMC3 format events, (iii) also tau polarimetric vectors prepared for user application of New Physics.

Abstract: Sodium iodide (NaI) is a widely used scintillator in direct dark matter searches. In particular, NaI-based cryogenic scintillating calorimeters have emerged as promising candidates, like in the COSINUS experiment, for testing the annually modulating signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA. In this study, we investigate defect formation within NaI crystals and its impact on the dark matter detection signal. Using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory techniques, we simulate a DM particle collision on an NaI crystal, focusing on the possible defects formation and their structural and electronic properties. Our analysis includes a detailed study of the electronic states associated with the interstitial atoms and vacancies, the energetic cost of defect formation, and the anisotropic threshold displacement energy. Finally, we highlight the potential to exploit dark matter-induced defects as a novel detection channel, enabled by the introduction of new states within the electronic band gap.

Abstract: We investigate the twist-2 unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of quarks for an on-shell gluon target in quantum chromodynamics. These GPDs parametrize the leading-twist matrix elements of the nonlocal light-like flavor-singlet vector current. We compute them at one-loop accuracy in perturbation theory using a quark mass and dimensional regularization as infrared regulators. In particular, we discuss the limit of vanishing momentum transfer. The present work extends our previous related study on the axial current.

Abstract: The Krauss-Nasri-Trodden (KNT) model provides a unified framework for addressing the smallness of neutrino masses (by a three-loop radiative mechanism) and the dark matter abundance (via thermal freeze-out) simultaneously. In this work, we investigate the implications of renormalization group effects on the model's parameter space. To this end, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to identify the viable regions of parameter space that is consistent with all the relevant experimental and theoretical constraints at low energies. We show that a significant portion of the low-energy viable region is incompatible with the vacuum stability conditions once the renormalization group effects are taken into account. Most of the remaining parameter space of the model can be probed in future charged lepton flavor violating experiments.

Abstract: Soft-Collinear Effective Theory is a framework for systematically organizing and resumming the logarithmic contributions that occur in high-energy reactions. It provides a factorized description of cross sections in terms of hard, jet, soft, and beam functions. As the latter are universal, they can be obtained from the well-known perturbative results in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan and Higgs boson productions. Using the recent results ~\cite{Kniehl:2025ttz} on four-loop eikonal $(f^I)$ and collinear anomalous dimensions $(B^I)$ for quarks and gluons, $I=q,g$, as well as perturbative results from previous orders, we present four-loop predictions for the quark and gluon soft and jet functions. They constitute an important component of the $N$-jettiness subtraction method at $\rm{N^4LO}$ accuracy in QCD, which eventually may enable the calculation of fully-differential cross sections at higher orders.

Abstract: In this work, we construct the $D$-wave isoscalar $ππ/K\bar K$ coupled-channel Omnès matrix, formulated to satisfy unitarity, analyticity, and the appropriate asymptotic behavior. We employ a two-channel $K$-matrix model containing poles associated with the $f_{2}(1270)$ and $f_{2}'(1525)$ resonances. The resulting unitary scattering matrix, which reproduces the experimental $ππ\toππ$ and $ππ\to K\bar K$ data and PDG information, serves as input to the homogeneous two-channel Muskhelishvili-Omnès equation. We compare our Omnès matrix with previous constructions based on $ππ\to K\bar K$ phases extracted from sums of Breit-Wigner amplitudes. The Omnès matrix developed here provides a reliable dispersive input for form-factor calculations and resonance studies in the tensor-meson sector. As an application, we show that it enables a simultaneous and accurate description of the BESIII $J/ψ\toπ^{0}π^{0}γ$ and $J/ψ\to K_{S}K_{S}γ$ spectra in the $J=2$ electric-dipole (E1) partial wave.

Abstract: Modified thermal distributions (dispersion relations) are introduced within both the MATTER and LBT event generators used to describe jet modification in a heavy-ion collision, within the JETSCAPE framework. Hard partons, propagating through dense matter, scatter off the partonic substructure of the medium, leading to stimulated emission, accompanied by recoiling medium partons. We introduce a simple modification, a multiplicative $(1 + a/T)$ correction to the dispersion relation of quarks and gluons (equivalent to an effective fugacity). This leads to calculated transport coefficients (e.g. $\hat{q}/T^3$) showing the expected behavior of depreciating at lower temperatures, including within the hot hadronic gas. This simple modification recovers the light-like dispersion relations at high temperatures, and introduces an excess depreciation factor for parton populations at lower temperatures, allowing partonic energy loss and recoil calculations to be extended into the hadronic phase. This modified distribution, in combination with initial state cold nuclear matter effects (shadowing), is used to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic anisotropy of jets and leading hadrons, over multiple centralities and collision energies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了进一步深入研究RAgAl系列化合物的磁性状态，特别是针对该系列中的TbAgAl化合物。

Method: 1. 在2K至300K的温度范围内，对TbAgAl化合物进行了高达12特斯拉强磁场的磁化强度测量。 2. 在相同温度范围和高达9特斯拉的磁场下，测量了其电阻率。

Result: 低温下的磁化测量显示，材料存在从反铁磁性到铁磁性的超磁性转变。同时，观察到的大矫顽力和磁化不饱和现象，以及电阻率测量结果，共同表明该化合物处于一种无序的磁性状态，内部同时存在铁磁性和反铁磁性交换作用。

Conclusion: TbAgAl 化合物中同时存在铁磁性和反铁磁性相互作用，形成了一种无序磁性状态，这可能归因于其层状结构。

Abstract: In order to further investigate the magnetic state of the RAgAl series, the magnetization measurements on the TbAgAl compound from this series have been extended to higher fields of 12 Tesla in the temperature range 2K-300K. The electrical resistivity in the temperature range 2-300K has been measured up to fields of 9 Tesla. The field dependence of magnetization at low temperatures suggests an antiferromagnetic state undergoing a metamagnetic transition to a ferromagnetic state above the critical field. The observation of large coercivity (unlike other compounds in the RAgAl series) and non-saturation of magnetization indicates a disordered magnetic state having both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. The presence of competing interactions leading to a disordered state is also supported by transport measurements and is attributed presumably to the layered structure of the compound.

TL;DR: 研究人员在一维半导体材料 Ta2NiS5 中，利用超快激光成功地在无掺杂的情况下诱导出了寿命长且数量显著的“三重子”（trion）激发现象，并揭示了其独特的形成路径与调控方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传统半导体中，“三重子”（Trion，一种由三个带电粒子组成的准粒子）通常需要通过载流子掺杂才能稳定存在。然而，在准一维材料中，即便没有掺杂，也观察到了三重子的迹象。本研究旨在探究能否在无掺杂的情况下，通过动态方式（如光激发）主动产生并控制这种奇特的量子态。

Method: 本文采用了时间分辨和角度分辨光电子能谱（tr-ARPES）技术。研究人员首先使用光脉冲激发准一维半导体材料 Ta2NiS5，然后实时追踪其电子能带结构的变化，从而观察激发后新出现的状态及其动态演化过程。

Result: 1. 成功在无掺杂的 Ta2NiS5 材料中通过光激发产生了明显且长寿的三重子布居，表现为一个带隙内的发光态。
2. 发现了一种非常规的三重子形成途径。
3. 揭示了三重子（带电激子）与普通激子（中性激子）之间存在一种依赖于激光能量的竞争关系。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了即使在没有掺杂的关联电子材料中，也可以通过光照动态地产生和控制三重子。这不仅将超快光电子能谱学的应用扩展到了对复杂束缚态的研究，也为未来动态调控量子材料中的带电与中性激子提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions in low-dimensional quantum materials give rise to emergent bound states such as excitons and trions, which play a central role in correlated electronic phases. In quasi-one-dimensional systems, equilibrium photoemission studies have reported signatures of trions, suggesting an unusually robust state, as opposed to conventional semiconductors where trions typically appear only as excited states stabilized by carrier doping. Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons. These findings extend ultrafast quasiparticle photoemission spectroscopy to complex bound states in bulk quantum materials, enabling the dynamical control of charged and neutral excitations.

Motivation: 阻挫近藤晶格是研究近藤效应、量子涨落与磁交换相互作用之间竞争的理想平台。本文旨在探究这种竞争关系。

Method: 通过对重费米子化合物 CePdIn 施加磁场和静水压力，调控其物理性质并进行观测。

Result: 在常压下，CePdIn 存在两个磁相变，且均会被磁场抑制。在零磁场下施加压力时，相变温度 $T_{m{N}}$ 呈现非单调变化：先下降，在 2.6 GPa 处突增，然后在约 5 GPa 附近消失。高压下的物相对磁场更不敏感。

Conclusion: 结果表明 CePdIn 中存在两个不同的反铁磁相，二者在 2.6 GPa 附近发生转变。这种相变可能是由于压力下近藤杂化增强，进而改变了其底层电子结构所驱动的。

Abstract: Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for studying how both the Kondo effect and quantum fluctuations compete with the magnetic exchange interactions that drive magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the effect of tuning the heavy-fermion compound CePdIn, which crystallizes in the geometrically frustrated ZrNiAl-type structure, using applied magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure, CePdIn exhibits two magnetic transitions, one at $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 1.65$ K and another at $T_{\rm{M}} \approx 1.15$ K, which are both suppressed by applied $c$-axis fields. Upon applying pressure in zero magnetic field, there is a non-monotonic evolution of $T_{\rm{N}}$, which decreases to 0.8 K at 2.3 GPa, before abruptly increasing to 1.5 K at 2.6 GPa. At higher pressures, $T_{\rm{N}}$ has a weak pressure dependence, and vanishes near 5 GPa. Together with the high-pressure phase being more robust to applied fields, these results suggest two distinct antiferromagnetic phases in CePdIn, which are separated near 2.6 GPa, and this change may be driven by the evolution of the underlying electronic structure due to enhanced Kondo hybridization under pressure.

Motivation: 尽管 Kagome 金属展现出丰富的关联电子物理现象，但学术界对于不同过渡金属元素如何影响其电子关联强度缺乏系统性的理解。

Method: 研究人员采用了密度泛函理论（DFT）与多轨道从属自旋平均场理论相结合的方法，对 Ti、V、Cr 基的 135 型化合物（含有 Sb 和 Bi）进行了研究。

Result: 研究发现，Cr 基材料的电子关联强度远强于 Ti 和 V 基材料，这源于 d 壳层更高的电子占据数和更低的特征动能这两个效应的协同作用。此外，用 Bi 替换 Sb 会增强所有化合物的关联性，并预测尚未合成的 CsCr₃Bi₅ 将是该家族中关联性最强的材料。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解和预测 Kagome 金属中的电子关联强度提供了一个定量的、基于能带结构的理论框架。

Abstract: Kagome metals exhibit rich correlated-electron physics, yet a systematic understanding of the degree of correlation across transition-metal species remains elusive. Using density-functional theory plus multi-orbital slave-spin mean-field theory, we investigate electronic correlations in the Ti-, V-, and Cr-based 135 compounds with Sb and Bi pnictogens. We find that the significantly stronger degree of correlation of the Cr-based materials compared to Ti and V can only be explained through the synergy of two effects: the larger electron filling of the $d$-shell and the reduced characteristic kinetic energy. We put forward that the substitution of Sb with Bi strengthens correlations in all compounds and make the prediction that the-yet-to-be-synthesized CsCr$_3$Bi$_5$ must be the most strongly correlated member of the entire family. These findings provide a quantitative, band-structure-based framework for understanding and predicting correlation strength in Kagome metals.

Motivation: 在凝聚态物理学中，p电子系统和d电子系统通常被视为两个独立的领域，这种划分掩盖了它们之间潜在的、深刻的物理统一性。本研究旨在打破这一界限，揭示其内在联系。

Method: 作者通过建立p轨道和t₂g轨道之间的“轨道同源性”来证明它们的等效性。核心方法是为t₂g轨道构建一个有效的l=1角动量代数，从而在数学上证明了它们拥有几乎相同的电子跳跃物理和自旋轨道耦合效应。

Result: 该理论统一了解释了多种量子材料中的复杂现象，包括非凡的能带拓扑、巡游铁磁性和非常规超导性。这一范式成功应用于过渡金属化合物、二维氧化物异质结、铁基超导体以及p轨道超冷气体等多种物理平台。

Conclusion: p-t₂g 轨道同源性不仅是一个用于解释现有现象的理论工具，更是一种可以指导设计和创造新奇量子态材料的稳健设计原则。

Abstract: The nominal divide between $p$- and $d$-electron systems often obscures a deep underlying unity in condensed matter physics. This review elucidates the orbital homology between the $p$ and $t_{2g}$ orbital manifolds, establishing the correspondence that extends from minimal model Hamiltonians to the complex behaviors of real quantum materials. We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states.

Conclusion: 该研究确定了La₄Ni₃O₁₀中的密度波（DW）是一种涉及多种声子模式的晶格纠缠不稳定性，并凸显了超快光学激发作为一种调控镍氧化物中竞争秩序的有力工具。

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized nickelates has renewed interest in the broken-symmetry states of their ambient-pressure parent phases, where a density-wave (DW) order emerges and competes with superconductivity, but its microscopic origin remains unresolved. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.

Motivation: 在动力学平均场理论计算中，传统方法面临两难：沿实轴演化计算成本高昂，而沿虚轴演化则难以准确恢复谱函数。因此，需要一种能够平衡计算成本和谱重构精度的更高效框架。

Method: 该研究提出了一种结合复数时间张量网络杂质求解器和基于指数拟合的解析延拓方案的框架。通过在复数时间等值线上进行时间演化，该方法在计算成本和谱重构的难度之间取得了平衡。然后，利用指数拟合方案，以极低的成本从复数时间数据中精确提取实时间信息。

Result: 所提出的方法能够以比实时演化低得多的计算成本，获得高分辨率的光谱数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为第一性原理研究强关联材料提供了一个非常有前景的工具。

Abstract: We present the combination of a complex-time tensor-network impurity solver with an analytic continuation scheme based on exponential fitting as an efficient framework for single and multi-orbital dynamical mean-field calculations. By performing time-evolution along a complex-time contour, the approach balances computational cost with the difficulty of spectral recovery, offering greater flexibility than methods confined to the real or imaginary axis. By complementing the complex-time evolution with an exponential fitting scheme, we faithfully extract real-time information at negligible cost. The resulting method obtains high-resolution spectra at a significantly lower computational cost than real-time evolution, offering a promising tool for ab initio studies of strongly correlated materials.

Abstract: The Pomeranchuk effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where liquid helium-3 (3He) solidifies under specific pressures, not when cooled, but when heated. This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions.

Abstract: Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.

Abstract: At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency {\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.

Abstract: The experimental discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in tunable moiré superlattices has sparked intense interest in exploring the interplay between topological order and symmetry breaking phases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive numerical study of this interplay through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations on a minimal two-band lattice model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at filling $ν=-2/3$. We find robust FQAH ground states and provide clear numerical evidences for anyon excitations with fractional charge and pronounced real-space density modulations, directly supporting the recently proposed anyon density-wave halo picture. We also map out the displacement field dependent phase diagram, uncovering a rich landscape of charge ordered states emerging from the FQAH, including a quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC) with an integer quantized Hall conductance. We expect our work to inspire further research interest of intertwined correlated topological phases in moiré systems.

Abstract: We present a diffuse neutron and x-ray scattering study of structural, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations in the electrical insulator La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$. This lamellar nickelate is an isostructural analogue of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, for which recent experiments uncovered evidence for unusual structural and superconducting fluctuations indicative of rare-region physics due to inherent inhomogeneity unrelated to common point disorder effects. We find closely analogous nanoscale orthorhombic fluctuation behavior in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$, including exponential scaling of the diffuse scattering intensity and power-law scaling of the characteristic length with relative temperature. Moreover, our neutron and x-ray scattering data reveal similar behavior for short-range magnetic and charge fluctuations above the respective ordering temperatures. These observations indicate that rare-region effects are a generic feature of perovskite-related structures and lead to universal fluctuations of both structural and electronic degrees of freedom over extended temperature ranges.

Abstract: We present a symbolic implementation of recursion method for the dynamics of strongly correlated fermions on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices. Focusing on two paradigmatic models, interacting spinless fermions and the Hubbard model, we first directly confirm that the universal operator growth hypothesis holds for interacting fermionic systems, manifested by the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients. Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters.

Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分区求解大型管网稳态流的方法。通过将大网络分解为小系统，在局部求解的基础上计算出全局解，这种方法尤其适用于不同运营商共同管理的网络，因为它仅需在互连点共享数据，保护了各自的内部数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型网络（如天然气或水管网）中的稳态流问题。随着网络规模的增大，求解由此产生的非线性方程组变得越来越困难。

Method: 提出一种分区算法。该算法将大型网络划分为可处理的子系统，通过局部求解这些子系统来计算整个非线性系统的全局解。当分区对应于不同运营商的网络时，该方法确保数据仅在互连点共享，各运营商可以独立求解自己的网络域。

Conclusion: 本文提出的分区算法能够有效求解大型网络中的非线性稳态流问题。它通过局部求解简化了计算复杂性，并在多运营商场景下保护了数据隐私，具有很高的工程应用价值。

Abstract: The solution of potential-driven steady-state flow in large networks is required in various engineering applications, such as transport of natural gas or water through pipeline networks. The resultant system of nonlinear equations depends on the network topology, and its solution grows more challenging as the network size increases. We present an algorithm that utilizes a given partition of a network into tractable sizes to compute a global solution for the full nonlinear system through local solution of smaller subsystems induced by the partitions. When the partitions are induced by interconnects or transfer points corresponding to networks owned by different operators, the method ensures data is shared solely at the interconnects, leaving network operators free to solve the network flow system corresponding to their own domain in any manner of their choosing. The proposed method is shown to be connected to the Schur complement and the method's viability demonstrated on some challenging test cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典方法（Hottel的区域法）在Noble的矩阵公式中存在一个先前未被发现的差异。为了消除这个差异并提供一个更精确、可靠的计算模型，作者提出了新的变换方法。

Method: 该研究提出了一种基于矩阵的交换因子变换方法。此方法利用一个初始的相互作用交换因子矩阵 F，通过诺伊曼级数（Neumann series）分析所有反射-散射路径直至稳态，从而生成一个吸收矩阵 A 和一个多重反射-散射矩阵 R。

Result: 该方法在严格的条件下能保证收敛性、非负辐射和精确到机器精度的能量守恒。它成功消除了传统方法中的差异，并与扩散近似法以及其他经典案例的结果进行了验证，显示出良好的一致性。该方法适用于中等规模的反射-散射问题，并在特定条件下（如高消光系数导致矩阵稀疏）可扩展到大规模问题。

Conclusion: 论文提出的交换因子变换是一种强大且精确的工具，用于解决具有混合边界条件的耦合辐射传热问题。它不仅修正了经典理论的缺陷，也为通用域上的辐射分析提供了可靠的计算框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a matrix-based exchange factor transformation for solving coupled mixed boundary condition radiative transfer problems on general domains. The method applies to participating media ranging from transparent to absorbing, emitting, and scattering, with boundaries ranging from absorbing to reflecting. Given a first-interaction exchange factor matrix $\mathbf{F}$, the transformation produces an absorption matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and a multiple reflection-scattering matrix $\mathbf{R}$ through a Neumann series that analytically traces all reflection-scattering paths to steady state. The paper establishes rigorous conditions under which the method guarantees convergence, non-negative radiation, and exact energy conservation to machine precision. A comparison with Noble's matrix formulation of Hottel's zonal method reveals a previously unidentified discrepancy in that classical approach; the proposed transformation eliminates this discrepancy. The method is validated against the diffusion approximation in the high-extinction limit and against results of Crosbie and Schrenker for pure and partial scattering cases. The method is applicable to medium-scale general reflecting-scattering problems and scales to large problems when negligible reflection-scattering and high extinction ensure matrix sparsity.

Motivation: 增材制造的连续纤维增强复合材料的性能对工艺参数非常敏感，导致全面的实验测试不切实际且成本高昂。

Method: 研究采用拉丁超立方采样（LHS）方法从4320种组合中高效地选择了155个样本进行打印和测试。然后，使用这些数据训练一个挤压-激励宽深神经网络（SE-WDNN）模型，以共同预测材料的多种力学和制造属性。

Result: 与其他常用机器学习模型相比，所提出的SE-WDNN模型取得了最低的总体测试误差（MAPE = 12.33%），并且在多个目标变量上显示出统计学上的显著改进。SHAP分析表明，增强策略是对力学性能影响最大的因素。

Conclusion: LHS和SE-WDNN的结合提供了一种可解释且样本高效的多目标预测方法，能够指导连续纤维增强复合材料增材制造中的参数选择，从而在力学行为和制造指标之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Continuous fiber-reinforced composite manufactured by additive manufacturing (CFRC-AM) offers opportunities for printing lightweight materials with high specific strength. However, their performance is sensitive to the interaction of process and material parameters, making exhaustive experimental testing impractical. In this study, we introduce a data-efficient, multi-input, multi-target learning approach that integrates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)-guided experimentation with a squeeze-and-excitation wide and deep neural network (SE-WDNN) to jointly predict multiple mechanical and manufacturing properties of CFRC-AMs based on different manufacturing parameters. We printed and tested 155 specimens selected from a design space of 4,320 combinations using a Markforged Mark Two 3D printer. The processed data formed the input-output set for our proposed model. We compared the results with those from commonly used machine learning models, including feedforward neural networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, XGBoost, CatBoost, and random forests. Our model achieved the lowest overall test error (MAPE = 12.33%) and showed statistically significant improvements over the baseline wide and deep neural network for several target variables (paired t-tests, p <= 0.05). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that reinforcement strategy was the major influence on mechanical performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that the integration of LHS and SE-WDNN enables interpretable and sample-efficient multi-target predictions, guiding parameter selection in CFRC-AM with a balance between mechanical behavior and manufacturing metrics.

Abstract: This work presents a survey of mechanical models describing van der Waals interactions between 2D materials, encompassing both continuous elastomer-like materials and discrete (crystalline) 2D materials such as graphene. These interactions give rise to a range of physical phenomena, including contact instabilities, Moiré patterns, surface reconstructions, and superlubricity. The underlying contact forces follow from the variation of an interfacial interaction potential. The presentation first discusses normal contact models, and then tangential contact models. Both atomistic and continuum approaches are considered. In addition, the influence of external loading and changes in length scale on the ground state configuration and frictional contact behavior are analyzed. A particular emphasis is placed on discussing strategies that reduce computational cost in multiscale modeling.

Abstract: Mesoscopic models of the optical response of metals have emerged as fundamental building blocks in quantum plasmonics, in principle overcoming the computational bottlenecks of ab initio techniques by implementing aspects of the atomistic description of the metal in otherwise classical calculations. Nonetheless, even these approaches are eventually hindered by demanding computations due to sophisticated material response. Here, this issue is addressed for the advanced Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Drude Model (SC-HDM), which captures both nonlocal electron dynamics and electron spill-out, through a Volume Integral Equation (VIE) method. Adopting an IE-based method shifts perspective from the commonly employed Differential Equation (DE)-based ones, demonstrating significant computational efficiency. The VIE approach is a valuable methodological scaffold: It addresses SC-HDM and simpler models, but can also be adapted to more advanced ones. For spherical nanoparticles (NPs), using the inherent symmetries, similar performance for three increasingly complicated material models is achieved, breaking the taboo that increased sophistication in material response requires taxing simulations. Mesoscopic material-response functions can be readily extracted from the VIE implementation, thus circumventing the need for lengthy microscopic calculations. This method opens a new way of modeling quantum hydrodynamic NPs and will serve as essential benchmarking tool for recipes addressing more complicated geometries.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent democratizes access to state-of-the-art computational methodologies, accelerating hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.

Abstract: We construct the first physics-informed neural-network (PINN) surrogates for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) using a hybrid PDE and data-driven workflow. Instead of training for the conservative form of the equations, we work with Jacobians or PDE characteristics directly in terms of primitive variables. We further add to the trainable system the divergence-free condition, without the need of cleaning modes. Using a novel MUON optimizer implementation, we show that a baseline PINN trained on early-time snapshots can extrapolate RMHD dynamics in one and two spatial dimensions, and that posterior residual-guided networks can systematically reduce PDE violations.

Abstract: Exponential divided differences arise in numerical linear algebra, matrix-function evaluation, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, where they serve as kernel weights for time evolution and observable estimation. Efficient and numerically stable evaluation of high-order exponential divided differences for dynamically evolving node sets remains a significant computational challenge. We present a Chebyshev-polynomial-based algorithm that addresses this problem by combining the Chebyshev-Bessel expansion of the exponential function with a direct recurrence for Chebyshev divided differences. The method achieves a computational cost of ${\cal O}(qN)$, where $q$ is the divided-difference order and $N$ is the Chebyshev truncation length. We show that $N$ scales linearly with the spectral width through the decay of modified Bessel coefficients, while the dependence on $q$ enters only through structural polynomial constraints. We further develop an incremental update scheme for dynamic node sets that enables the insertion or removal of a single node in ${\cal O}(N)$ time when the affine mapping interval is held fixed. A full \texttt{C++} reference implementation of the algorithms described in this work is publicly available.

Abstract: We present a space-time extension of a conservative Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for two-phase diffusion in prescribed-motion geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: one scalar field is solved in each phase with discontinuous material properties, coupled by sharp interface conditions enforcing flux continuity and jump laws. To handle moving boundaries on a fixed Cartesian grid, the discrete balance is written over phase-restricted space-time control volumes, whose geometric moments (swept volumes and apertures) are used as weights in the finite-volume operators. This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a methodology that aims to solve physical systems by directly embedding PDE constraints into the neural network training process. In electromagnetism, where well-established methodologies such as FDTD and FEM already exist, new methodologies are expected to provide clear advantages to be accepted. Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in terms of accuracy and energy metrics when compared to FDTD solutions. This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency.
  This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed.
  In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario. Training is performed without labeled field data, using only physics-based residual losses; FDTD is used solely for post-training evaluation. The results demonstrate that PINNs can achieve competitive results with FDTD in canonical electromagnetic examples and are a viable alternative.

Abstract: MulAtoLEG (Multi-Atom Liouville Equation Generator) is an open-source Mathematica package for generating Liouville superoperators and Liouville equations, specialized for multilevel atomic systems comprising an arbitrary number of atoms. This scheme is based on an extension to multilevel atomic systems, originally developed by Lehmberg [R. H. Lehmberg, Phys. Rev. A 2, 883 (1970)] as an adjoint master equation for ensembles of two-level emitters and later reformulated by Genes [M. Reitz, C. Sommer and C. Genes, PRX Quantum 3, 010201 (2022)] as a master equation. The package facilitates the generation of equations for complex transition configurations in alkali atoms. Although primarily designed for atomic systems, it can also generate the master and adjoint master equations for general Hamiltonians and Lindbladians. In addition, it includes functionalities to construct the differential equations in the dressed-state basis, where, in many cases, the non-unitary evolution operator can be determined explicitly. To maximize computational efficiency, the package leverages Mathematica's vectorization and sparse linear algebra capabilities. Since MulAtoLEG produces exact equations without approximations, the feasible system size is naturally limited by the available computational resources.

Abstract: We investigate the representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals. Crystal symmetries are usually described as the finite symmetry group of a finite crystal with periodic boundary conditions, for which the Brillouin zone is a finite set of points. However, to deal with the continuous crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$ required to discuss the continuity, singularity or analyticity of band energies $ε_n(\mathbf{k})$ and Bloch states $ψ_{\mathbf{k}}$, we need to consider infinite crystals. The symmetry groups of infinite crystals belong to the category of infinite non-compact groups, for which many standard tools of group theory break down. For example, character theory is no longer available for these groups and we use harmonic analysis to build the group algebra, the regular representation, the induction of irreducible representations of the crystallographic group from projective representations of the point groups and the decomposition of a representation into its irreducible parts. We deal with magnetic and non-magnetic groups in arbitrary dimensions. In the last part of the paper, we discuss Mackey's restriction of an induced representation to a subgroup, the tensor product of induced representations and the symmetric and antisymmetric squares of induced representations.

Motivation: 在陶瓷制备中，降低单相多组分氧化物（如此处的透辉石）的形成温度是一个经典的挑战。本研究希望通过探索不同的湿化学合成路径来解决这个问题。

Method: 论文比较了两种主要的湿化学方法来合成透辉石：溶胶-凝胶法（使用/不使用碱性催化剂）和共沉淀法（一步滴加和逐滴滴加沉淀剂）。作者使用相关的氯化物作为前驱体，并通过煅烧处理，最后根据产物的结晶度和均匀性进行评估。

Result: 研究发现，溶胶-凝胶法效果不佳，产生了多相和低结晶度的结构。相比之下，共沉淀法更为成功：一步加入沉淀剂的方式可以间接在低温下形成纳米透辉石；而逐滴加入的方式则能直接结晶，但结晶度稍差。

Conclusion: 通过选择合适的合成工艺（特别是共沉淀法），可以实现在低温煅烧后，对各种纳米颗粒透辉石基结构的有效控制。

Abstract: Reducing the formation temperature of single-phase multioxides is one of the classic challenges in ceramic processing, including wet-chemical synthesis routes. Toward pursuing this aim for diopside (MgCaSi2O6), the merit of different sol-gel and coprecipitation processes using the related chloride precursors followed by calcination was compared from the viewpoints of crystallinity and homogeneity. In accordance to the results, the use of the sol-gel techniques, directed with/without an alkaline catalyst, gave rise to the unfavorable creation of multiphase and low-crystallinity structures. Regarding the coprecipitation methods, the one-step addition of a precipitant agent is accompanied by an indirect low-temperature formation of nano-diopside, while a direct crystallization into this phase was explored in the dropwise condition, albeit with a lower crystallinity. Thus, by employing a suitable synthesis processing, it is feasible to take control of a wide range of nanoparticulate diopside-based structures achieved after a low-temperature calcination.

Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.

Motivation: 在钙钛矿太阳能电池（PSCs）中，钙钛矿材料与空穴传输层（HTL）之间的界面对于优化电荷转移和提升器件效率至关重要。该研究旨在深入理解钙钛矿的表面终端（即暴露在外的化学基团）如何影响界面的稳定性和电子结构，从而为设计更高性能的太阳能电池提供理论依据。

Method: 研究采用了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算方法。研究人员构建了两种界面模型：甲基铵碘（MAI）终端的MAPbI3表面与P3HT接触，以及碘化铅（PbI）终端的MAPbI3表面与P3HT接触。通过计算和比较这两种模型的电子结构、能带对齐、电荷密度差和态密度等电子特性，来分析界面差异。

Result: 计算结果显示，PbI终端界面比MAI终端界面表现出更强的轨道杂化和电子耦合，从而促进了更高效的电荷转移。两种界面都形成了有利于空穴传输的II型能带结构，但在PbI终端上更为显著。此外，PbI终端界面的有效质量更轻，而MAI终端界面的空穴速度更高。

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，钙钛矿的表面终端类型是影响其与P3HT界面电荷传输机制的关键。与MAI终端相比，PbI终端能带来更强的电子耦合和更高效的电荷转移。这些理论发现为优化钙钛矿-有机混合太阳能电池的界面设计以提高性能提供了指导。

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells.

Motivation: 计算多主元合金（高熵合金）中的平衡空位浓度是一个充满争议且复杂的问题，主要障碍在于其化学复杂性和化学短程有序（CSRO）的存在。

Method: 研究者们从多个角度推导出了一个可用于原子尺度计算的精确表达式，用以计算平衡空位浓度，并将其应用于面心立方（FCC）结构的等原子CrCoNi合金。

Conclusion: 该研究结果表明，本文提出的方法具有实用性，能有效预测复杂成分合金中的平衡空位浓度。

Abstract: The equilibrium vacancy concentration in multi-principal element alloys remains a controversial and nontrivial subject, primarily because of chemical complexity and chemical short-range order (CSRO). Here we derive an exact expression that is amenable to atomistic calculations, using multiple perspectives. We applied this expression to equiatomic CrCoNi alloys in the face-centered cubic structure. The derived equilibrium vacancy concentration is used in our recent work, which predicts the chemical short-range order formation timescale consistent with experimental observation. The results demonstrate the practical utility of the approach for predicting equilibrium vacancy concentrations in compositionally complex alloys.

TL;DR: 本文使用SSAdNDP方法，通过分析晶格振动（声子）如何改变MgB2、石墨烯和hBN等材料中的化学键，为电子-声子耦合现象提供了化学层面的直观解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索声子扰动如何引起费米能级附近的电子简并破缺，并希望通过SSAdNDP方法从化学键的角度来直观地理解这一响应。

Method: 研究人员将SSAdNDP（对称性适应共享空间自适应自然密度划分）方法应用于一系列六方结构材料（二硼化镁、石墨烯和六方氮化硼），用以分析单个声子模式如何同时改变材料的电子结构（能带色散）和实空间中的化学键性质（自然占据数和节点模式）。

Result: 研究结果表明，只有当能带分裂伴随着电子的重新分布时（具体表现为化学键占据数或成键拓扑结构的变化），这种分裂才具有显著的物理意义。

Conclusion: SSAdNDP方法在倒易空间表征（能带结构）和实空间表征（化学键）之间建立了直接的桥梁，将电子-声子耦合等现象转化为化学上直观的多中心键重组，为解释固体中由振动驱动的电子效应提供了统一的框架。

Abstract: This work explores how phonon perturbations can induce the breaking of electronic degeneracies near the Fermi level and how this response can be interpreted from a chemical perspective through the SSAdNDP method. We apply this approach to a family of structurally similar yet electronically distinct hexagonal materials-MgB2, graphene, and hBN-to analyze how a single phonon mode simultaneously modifies the electronic structure (band dispersion) and the nature of chemical bonding (natural occupations and nodal patterns) in real space. Our results show that band splitting becomes physically relevant only when it is accompanied by an electronic redistribution, reflected in changes of the occupation numbers or bonding topology. Thus, SSAdNDP provides a direct bridge between reciprocal- and real-space representations, translating phenomena such as electron-phonon coupling into chemically intuitive reorganizations of multicenter bonds, and offering a unified framework to interpret vibrationally driven electronic effects in solids.

TL;DR: 本文使用一种超快激光技术，通过激发材料的晶格振动（声子）来研究其对离子传导的影响，发现这种方法能更有效地提升原本导电性较差的有序固态电解质的离子电导率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固态材料中的离子传导不仅受静态结构影响，也受晶格振动（声子）等动态因素影响。然而，由于离子跳跃速度极快，直接通过实验测量声子的作用充满挑战。本研究旨在克服这些困难，以理解声子在离子传导中的动态角色。

Method: 作者使用了一种名为“激光驱动超快阻抗谱”（LUIS）的技术。该方法使用太赫兹（THz）激光共振激发材料中的晶格振动（声子），并以皮秒级的时间分辨率来探测离子的跳跃行为。他们将此技术应用于$Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$（LLZO）的两种晶相：导电性差的四方相（t-LLZO）和导电性好的立方相（c-LLZO）。

Result: 研究发现，在用0.5-7.5 THz范围的声子激发后，导电性较差的四方相LLZO（t-LLZO）相比于立方相LLZO（c-LLZO），其阻抗表现出更长的离子跳跃衰减信号。这表明，在离子排列有序且占据充分的材料中，声子介导的离子传导能引起更大的离子位移。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了材料的静态结构和动态晶格振动之间的相互作用。通过太赫兹声子模式来调控晶格动力学，可以显著提高那些原本因结构有序而导电性不佳的无机固体的离子电导率。

Abstract: Superionic conduction in solid-state materials is governed not only by static factors, such as structure and composition, but also by dynamic interactions between the mobile ion and the crystal lattice. Specifically, the dynamics of lattice vibrations, or phonons, have attracted interest because of their hypothesized ability to facilitate superionic conduction. However, direct experimental measurement of the role of phonons in ionic conduction is challenging due to the fast intrinsic timescales of ion hopping and the difficulty of driving relevant phonon modes, which often lie in the low-energy THz regime. To overcome these limitations, we use laser-driven ultrafast impedance spectroscopy (LUIS). LUIS resonantly excites phonons using a THz field and probes ion hopping with picosecond time resolution. We apply LUIS to understand the dynamical role of phonons in $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ (LLZO). When in its cubic phase (c-LLZO), this garnet-type solid electrolyte has an ionic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than its tetragonal phase (t-LLZO). T-LLZO is characterized by an ordered and filled $Li^+$ sublattice necessitating synchronous ion hopping. In contrast, c-LLZO is characterized by a disordered and vacancy-rich $Li^+$ sublattice, and has a conduction mechanism dominated by single hops. We find that, upon excitation of phonons in the 0.5-7.5 THz range, the impedance of t-LLZO experiences a longer ion hopping decay signal in comparison to c-LLZO. The results suggest that phonon-mediated ionic conduction by THz modes may lead to larger ion displacements in ordered and fully occupied mobile ion sublattices as opposed to those that are disordered and vacancy-rich. Overall, this work highlights the interplay between static and dynamic factors that enables improved ionic conductivity in otherwise poorly conducting inorganic solids.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了CoI₂材料，发现其虽有很强的Kitaev相互作用，但也存在阻碍其成为量子自旋液体（QSL）的几何阻挫。作者提出通过将部分Co原子替换为Mg原子，可以抑制这种几何阻挫，从而使改造后的Co₂/₃Mg₁/₃I₂材料成为一个极具潜力的Kitaev QSL候选材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了寻找可用于拓扑量子计算的Kitaev量子自旋液体（QSL）材料。理想的材料需要具备强的键依赖阻挫（bond-dependent frustration）和弱的几何阻挫（geometric frustration）。

Method: 研究人员通过第一性原理计算，结合自旋轨道态和Wannier函数分析、精确对角化（ED）以及密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）等方法，对三角晶格反铁磁体CoI₂的电子结构和磁性进行了研究，并在此基础上提出了通过元素替换来优化材料性能的方案。

Result: 研究发现，CoI₂中存在强的Kitaev相互作用（K₁）和弱的海森堡相互作用（J₁），但较强的三次近邻相互作用（J₃）引入了不希望的几何阻挫，导致其呈现螺旋反铁磁序。理论计算表明，通过用Mg部分取代Co形成Co₂/₃Mg₁/₃I₂，可以有效抑制J₃，从而减弱几何阻挫，同时保持强的键依赖阻挫。

Conclusion: CoI₂本身并非理想的Kitaev量子自旋液体材料，但通过掺杂Mg调控，Co₂/₃Mg₁/₃I₂材料有望成为迄今为止最接近Kitaev量子自旋液体态的候选材料之一。

Abstract: Kitaev materials are of great interest due to their potential in realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and applications in topological quantum computing. In the pursuit of realizing Kitaev QSL, a Mott insulator with strong bond-dependent frustration and weak geometric frustration is highly desirable. Here we explore Kitaev physics in the van der Waals triangular antiferromagnet (AF) CoI$_2$, through the spin-orbital states and Wannier function analyses, exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties. We find that the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ ion is in the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ state because of strong spin-orbit coupling, and the weak trigonal elongation and crystal field contribute to the observed weak in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The strong $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping via the strong Co 3$d$-I 5$p$ hybridization gives rise to a strong Kitaev interaction ($K_1$) at the first nearest neighbors (1NN), and the long Co-Co distance and the weak $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hoppings determine a weak Heisenberg interaction $J_1$. The resultant $|K_1/J_1|$ = 6.63 confirms a strong bond-dependent frustration, while the geometric frustration due to the 3NN Heisenberg interaction $J_3$ gets involved, and they all together result in the experimental helical AF order in CoI$_2$. We then propose to suppress the $J_3$ using a partial Mg substitution for Co, and indeed we find that Co$_{2/3}$Mg$_{1/3}$I$_2$ has the much reduced geometric frustration but hosts the robust bond-dependent frustration, and thus it would be a promising Kitaev material being so far closest to the QSL state.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the chemical states both in the bulk and at the interfaces of complex oxide thin films is essential for engineering a wide range of electronic, optical, and magnetic functionalities, which arise through emergent phenomena such as two-dimensional electron gases, interfacial magnetism, and associated phase transitions. Here, we demonstrate the use of in situ Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) as a powerful tool for probing oxidation states and dynamic chemical processes during the growth of complex oxide heterostructures. By leveraging the chemical sensitivity of AES to subtle changes in valence electron populations, we show that this technique can distinguish distinct oxidation states in multivalent perovskite manganate and vanadate systems with high fidelity during deposition. Furthermore, we show evidence for dynamic chemical phenomena, specifically charge transfer processes at the polar-nonpolar LaMnO3/SrTiO3 interface. Our results establish in situ AES as a powerful diagnostic tool for monitoring and controlling interfacial chemistry during thin film growth, offering a pathway toward the atomic-scale engineering of chemical states in functional oxide heterostructures.

Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics investigation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) adsorption at the aqueous-biochar interface using experimentally constrained woody biochar models representative of softwood-derived biochars produced at 400, 600 and 800 $°$C. The models reproduce experimental descriptors (H/C, O/C, aromaticity, true density, and surface functionality) of their experimental counterparts, and simulations enable calculation of adsorption isotherms that align with available experimental measurements. Our results reveal that 2,4-D$^{-}$ uptake is governed by a synergy of three interaction classes: (i) $π$-$π$ and $π$-Cl contacts with graphitic domains with either parallel or perpendicular alignments, (ii) polar interactions including H-bonding to surface -OH and other oxygen-containing groups, and (iii) Na$^{+}$-mediated cation bridging that links 2,4-D$^{-}$ anion to surface oxygens, that would have an increasing relevance for biochars near or above the pH at point of zero charge. Notably, we found that low-temperature produced biochars, which retain higher densities of surface O functionalities, exhibit higher adsorption per unit surface area due to cooperative polar interactions alongside $π$-$π$ binding, whereas medium-to-high temperature biochars rely more on $π$-$π$ and cation-bridging mechanisms. The distinct adsorption distances measured emphasize surface heterogeneity and porosity. Taken together, these atomistic insights corroborate experimental observations and yield actionable guidance for the rational design of biochars for remediation of anionic herbicides, highlighting how surface functionality and solution chemistry can be tuned to optimize sorption. Our approach provides a general framework to interrogate pollutant-biochar interactions and to inform remediation strategies.

Abstract: In this work, we study the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) behavior of [001] epitaxial Fe65Co35 thin films along different crystallographic directions as a function of temperature. The AMR ratio is found to strongly depend on the current orientation relative to the crystal axes, reaching 0.16 % and 0.10 % at room temperature when the current is applied along the magnetic hard and easy axes, respectively. Moreover, the AMR ratio decreases at different rates as the temperature is reduced to 80 K. The longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance curves were fitted using the Stoner-Wohlfarth formalism to describe the magnetization reversal path and to extract the magnetic anisotropy constants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = -2.36 kJ/m3 and Ku = 2.18 kJ/m3, verifying the change in the cubic anisotropy compared to Fe-richer Fe100-xCox compositions. These results demonstrate that by tailoring the crystalline orientation and temperature dependence of AMR, epitaxial Fe65Co35 thin films can enable the design of magnetic sensors with tunable sensitivity.

Abstract: Emerging spin-orbit-torque devices based on spin valves require an ultrathin (e.g., $\lesssim$2 nm) magnetic free layer to maximize the torque per moment. However, reducing the free-layer thickness deteriorates the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) signal for electrical readout. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of a 1-nm Cu seed layer enables high GMR ratios of 5-7% at free-layer thicknesses of $\lesssim$2 nm by promoting high-quality, textured growth of spin valves. Our work offers a pathway for engineering high-signal GMR readout in spin-orbit-torque digital memories and neuromorphic computers.

Abstract: Deformable and flexible electronics have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties; however, their current applications are primarily limited to the thermoelectric domain. Expanding the range of these electronics and their application scope represents a pivotal trend in their development. In this work, a plastic inorganic semiconductor material, Sn2BiS2I3, with a band gap of 1.2 eV was synthesized and fabricated into a three-electrode flexible and portable electronic tongue capable of detecting heavy metal elements. The electronic tongue device exhibits exceptional linearity and demonstrates resistance against interference from impurity ions. The linear regression equation is expressed as Y=0.24+19.06X, yielding a linear coefficient of approximately 0.96, and the detectable limit stands at around 1.1 ppb, surpassing the 2.0 ppb limit of the ICP-AES instrument. Furthermore, mechanical testing reveals the favorable plasticity of Sn2BiS2I3, as evidenced by the absence of cracks during nanoindentation. The indentation hardness of Sn2BiS2I3 is approximately 1.67 GPa, slightly exceeding the hardness of Cu, which is 1.25 GPa. This study expands the repertoire of deformable and flexible electronics, offering a new and exceptional choice for biomimetic tongue sensor materials.

Abstract: $SrVO_3$ (SVO), a model correlated metal and a promising transparent conducting oxide, develops a several-nanometer-thick near-surface region (NSR), rich in $V^{5+}$ species under ambient conditions. This oxidized layer obscures the intrinsic correlated-metallic $V^{4+}$ character and limits both fundamental studies of the physics and the material's integration into electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a direct and controllable approach for recovering the metallic SVO surface by thermally reducing the NSR under ultra-high vacuum. Real-time in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a sharp transformation from a $V^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states, dominated by $V^{4+}$, and a recovery of its metallic character. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) suggest that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and partial oxygen loss, leading to nanoscale surface reorganization and modest lattice expansion. While thermodynamic considerations motivate evaluation of a $V_2O_5$ volatilization pathway, the combined experimental evidence instead points toward a predominantly structural surface reorganization. These findings establish a practical method for obtaining predominantly $V^{4+}$ SVO surfaces without protective capping layers, a capability that expands the utility of SVO for advanced spectroscopies, interface engineering, and oxide-electronics device integration.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic ordering and phonon dynamics of the GdCrO$_3$ orthorhombic perovskite. The Ce doped compound exhibits long-range canted antiferromagnetism with Neel transitions, T$_N$ at $\sim$ 173 K, accompanied by spin-flip, T$_{SF}$ at $\sim$ 10 K. Ce$^{3+}$ incorporation drives a modification of the spin-flip transition from the $Γ{(G_x,A_y,F_z)}$ configuration to $Γ$ inducing a reorientation of the spin axis between the (001) and (001) crystallographic planes. This spin reorientation is governed by Zeeman energy and produces pronounced field-induced irreversibility between FCC and FCW magnetization processes. The substituted compound Gd$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (GCCO) exhibits a remarkably large magnetic entropy change, $Δ$ S $\sim$ 45-40 J/kg-K for $Δ$ H = 90-70 kOe at 3 K among the highest reported for rare-earth orthochromites. The interplay of spin-only magnetocrystalline anisotropy from Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit-driven magnetic moments of Gd$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ results in pronounced spin-phonon coupling, manifested through the A$_{1g}$(6) vibrational mode. The observed temperature-dependent spectral evolution is consistent with behaviour reported in isostructural magnetic perovskites.

Abstract: We report the influence of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic structures and phonon dynamics in SmCrO$_3$ perovskites. Magnetic landscapes are spanned by long-range canted anti-ferromagnetism, AFM with Neel temperatures $\sim$196 K accompanied by spin-reorientation transitions, T$_{SRPT}$ at 42 K. In Sm$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (SCCO), Ce$^{3+}$ substitution at Sm$^{3+}$ sites transform the weak ferromagnetic (FM) $Γ_4$ state into robust AFM $Γ_1$ configuration through a gradual crossover. Such coexistence of magnetic spin configurations $Γ_1$(AFM) to $Γ_4$ (WFM) results in the enhanced high coercive field and a pronounced exchange bias-field, $H_{\mathrm{EB}}$ $\sim$ 2 kOe. Spin-only driven magneto-crystalline anisotropy of Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit driven magnetic moment in Sm$^{3+}$, and Ce$^{3+}$ exhibits spin-phonon coupling through $A_{1g}(6)$ mode in SCCO are consistent with the temperature dependent spectral features of the isostructural magnetic systems and quite significant in SCCO which is in accordance with the higher structural distortion in SCCO. These results demonstrate that site-specific R$^{3+}$ substitution modulates lattice distortions, spin-phonon coupling, and spin-orbit interactions, offering pathways to optimize perovskites for diverse spintronic applications.

Abstract: We demonstrate anisotropic photostriction in two-dimensional orthorhombic semiconductors using time-dependent density functional theory. By tracing the dynamics of photoexcited carriers, we establish a quantitative link between carrier density and lattice deformation in layered black phosphorus and germanium selenides. The structural response exhibits significant anisotropy, featuring lattice expansion along the armchair direction and contraction along the zigzag direction, which is attributed to the interplay between charge redistribution and intrinsic lattice anisotropy. Both the magnitude and orientation of the photostrictive strains can be tuned by photodoping densities, enabling precise control over the photoinduced response. Notably, the photoinduced strains significantly increase carrier recombination lifetimes by suppressing nonradiative recombination, primarily due to the enlarged bandgap and weakened nonadiabatic coupling. These results provide microscopic insight into the origin of anisotropic photostriction in low-dimensional systems and lay the groundwork for light-controllable, directionally sensitive optomechanical devices at the atomic scale.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices.

Abstract: Topological magnetic textures are particle-like spin configurations stabilized by competing interactions. Their formation is commonly attributed to fluctuation-driven, first-order nucleation processes requiring activation over a topological energy barrier. Here, we demonstrate an alternative barrier- and fluctuation-free pathway for nucleating topological magnetic textures, triggered in our experiments by an excitation-induced spin reorientation transition. By combining x-ray imaging, scattering and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the system follows a deterministic cascade of symmetry-breaking phase transitions after excitation. First, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition from a homogeneous state to weak stripe domains, then a first-order transition to topologically trivial bubbles, and finally a topological switching event into skyrmionic textures. Through simulations, we generalize our findings and demonstrate that this pathway is active in a vast range of low-anisotropy materials. This previously unrecognized, spontaneous transition pathway suggests strategies for rapid, low-energy generation of topological spin textures and points to a general role of intrinsic modulational instabilities in phase transitions beyond magnetism.

Abstract: Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cerium-based lanthanide high-entropy oxides (LN-HEOs) are promising candidates for solid-state electrolyte (mass transport) applications due to their ability to accommodate high concentrations of oxygen vacancies while retaining a fluorite-derived structure. However, synthesis often yields undesired ordered oxygen-deficient phases, such as bixbyite, depending on composition and processing conditions. We utilize first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate phase stability in the model system Ce$_x$(YLaPrSm)$_{1-x}$O$_{2-δ}$, with the aim of elucidating the thermodynamic factors governing fluorite-bixbyite competition and identifying structure-property relationships to oxygen transport. By independently varying cerium concentration and oxygen vacancy content, we predict that the transition from disordered fluorite to ordered bixbyite is driven primarily by compositional and vacancy-ordering effects, rather than through changes in cation valence. Free-energy analysis reveals that at high vacancy concentrations, bixbyite is enthalpically favored due to ordered oxygen vacancies, while fluorite is stabilized at lower vacancy concentrations and higher cerium content through configurational entropy of the anion sublattice. These DFT results clarify the competing energetic contributions that control phase stability and structure-valence relationships in LN-HEOs and establishes a mechanistic framework for designing vacancy-tolerant oxide electrolytes with tunable phase behavior.

Abstract: Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ has been refined in the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase without octahedral rotations, and its physical properties have been interpreted in this high-symmetry structure. However, the dynamical stability of this undistorted phase has not previously been questioned. It is important to establish whether other lower-symmetry structures are energetically more favorable because octahedral rotations control electronic bandwidths and constrain which magnetic interactions are allowed by symmetry. Here I compute first-principles phonon dispersions of $I4/mmm$ Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ including spin-orbit interaction. I find a nearly-flat nondegenerate unstable branch along the Brillouin-zone boundary segment $XP$ associated with inplane rotations of the IrO$_6$ octahedra. Using group-theoretical analysis, I enumerate the symmetry-allowed distortions associated with the $X_2^+$ and $P_4$ instabilities and fully relax the resulting structures. Only five of the twelve possible distortions can be stabilized, and the energy gain scales with the number of layers that exhibit octahedral rotations: phases with rotations in every IrO$_6$ layer are lower by $-5.8$ meV/atom and are nearly degenerate with respect to the stacking phase. Electronic structure calculations show that these rotated phases host a narrow and well-separated half-filled $J_{\textrm{eff}} = 1/2$ manifold, whereas structures with rotations only in alternate layers have broader and more entangled bands. This motivates a reinvestigation of the crystal structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and indicates that octahedral rotations should be considered in modeling its correlated electronic and magnetic properties.

Abstract: Altermagnets demonstrate significant potential in spintronics due to their unique non-relativistic spin-splitting properties, yet altermagnetic devices still face challenges in efficiently switching logic states. Here, we report electrostatically controllable spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO and design a dual-gate altermagnetic tunnel junction (AMTJ), which can switch between high and low resistance states without switching the Néel vector. First-principles calculations demonstrate that vertical electric field can induce significant spin splitting in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Reversing the electric field direction can alter the spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Leveraging this electric-field-tunable spin splitting, the dual-gate AMTJ exhibits an ultrahigh tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of $10^{7}$. This work provides theoretical support for the design of fully electrically controlled AMTJs and demonstrates their great potential for applications in spintronic devices.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities to realize emergent phenomena by reducing dimensionality. Using scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we determine an intriguing case of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a bulk compound, (TBA)$_{0.3}$VSe$_2$. Atomic-scale imaging reveals that the initial $4a_0 \times 4a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) order in 1T-VSe$_2$ transforms to $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ ordering upon intercalation, which is associated with an insulating gap with a magnitude of up to approximately 115 meV. Our calculations reveal that this energy gap is highly tunable through electron doping introduced by the intercalant. Moreover, the robustness of the $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ CDW order against the Lifshitz transition points to the key role of electron-phonon interactions in stabilizing the CDW state. Our work clarifies a rare example of a CDW-driven MIT in quasi-2D materials and establishes cation intercalation as an effective pathway for tuning both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration without inducing strain or disorder.

Abstract: The interplay between laser parameters and liquid environments dictates the outcome of femtosecond laser-induced nanoparticle modification. We present a study of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles in water and a water-acetone mixture, irradiated with femtosecond lasers at 808 nm and 404 nm. While aggregation was observed in pure water at both wavelengths, the results revealed a strong stability and a rather unexpected wavelength-dependency in the acetone-water mixture. In this case, 808 nm irradiation produced some decrease in nanoparticle sizes, while 404 nm led to some nanoparticle growth. As a result, the acetone effect is found to be twofold: (i) on one hand, it helps to prevent aggregation; (ii) on the other hand, it acts as a reactive medium allowing to tune the nanoparticle size and composition simply by changing laser wavelength. So, this work emphasizes that solvent physical properties as well as laser-induced chemical processes in the solvent are not merely secondary effects but can dominate the final morphological outcome, providing a predictive framework for nanoparticle synthesis.

Abstract: Graphene, a two-dimensional monolayer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice, possesses exceptional electronic, mechanical, and quantum properties, making it highly attractive for energy storage, spintronics, and microelectronics. Functionalizing graphene with platinum (Pt) adatoms can further enhance its properties, particularly for hydrogen storage applications. In this study, we experimentally investigate hydrogen adsorption on Pt-decorated graphene using Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA). By irradiating the Pt/graphene film with a 4.1 MeV C2+ ion beam and detecting recoiled hydrogen atoms at a 30 degree scattering angle, we obtain the hydrogen depth profile, providing critical insights into its storage behavior.

Abstract: The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D sheet of gold exfoliated from $Ti_3AuC_2$, offers high specific surface area (~260 $m^2g^{-1}$), roughly twice that of fine nanodots (~100 $m^2g^{-1}$), and unique electronic properties due to its dense d-orbital. In this work, we investigate the adsorption of single atom catalyst (SAC) of hydrogen atom on pristine goldene (pG), monovacant goldene (vG), and sulfur-functionalized variants (thiol-pG and thiol-vG) using ab initio calculations. The adsorption energy of a single H atom and $ΔG_H$, determines the efficiency of the Volmer step of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and is a key descriptor for HER activity. We explore various potential sites for H adsorption and its impact on descriptors such as Bader charges, d-band shift and the exchange current density.

Abstract: Order versus disorder in the structure of materials plays a key role in the theoretical prediction of their properties. However, this structural description appears to be ineffective for new families of materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs), which combine crystallographic order with chemical disorder. Here, we demonstrate for five-element HEAs as pure solid solutions that the chemical disorder of the elements decorating their cubic structure underlies the generation of second optical harmonics, overcoming the theoretical limit imposed on centrosymmetric crystals. Moreover, we discover that this disorder, inherent to HEAs, sets a threshold for non-linear light emission from the 4th to the 26th order. As a consequence of the 0.5 eV broadening of the energy levels of the five elements of the HEA, the emission spectrum covers broad visible (400-650 nm) and infrared (800-1600 nm) ranges. In addition to the challenge of theoretically predicting non-linear effects in unconventional materials, the duality of structural order and chemical disorder in HEAs offers the opportunity to design sustainable alternatives to urgently needed optical materials.

Abstract: Theoretical simulation is helpful for accurate interpretation of experimental X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra that contain rich atomic and electronic structure information of materials. However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 55%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction.

Abstract: Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 °C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes.

Abstract: Phosphorus-based lubricant additives are used for protecting metallic contacts under boundary lubrication by forming surface films that reduce wear and friction. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扭曲多层莫尔材料中的准周期性（一种空间不均匀性）通常被认为不利于超导。然而，实验在准周期性的扭曲三层石墨烯（TTG）中却观察到了超导现象。本文旨在研究并解释这种看似矛盾的现象背后的物理机制。

Method: 研究人员通过大规模的数值模拟方法，具体包括波函数计算和久保（Kubo）电导率计算，来系统性地研究扭曲三层石墨烯的超导特性。

Result: 研究发现，准周期性与拓扑之间的相互作用将扭曲三层石墨烯推入一个“临界状态”。这个临界金属态的特征是多重分形波函数和类似于整数量子霍尔平台转变的标度不变输运特性。正是这种临界性使得该材料能在很宽的扭转角范围内展现出稳固的超导电性，而非仅限于某个特定的“魔角”。

Conclusion: 该研究得出的一个明确实验启示是：通过施加压力来增强扭曲三层石墨烯中的层间耦合，可以进一步稳定其临界状态和超导电性，使得超导现象在更宽的角度范围和实验可及的条件下被观测到。

Abstract: Twisted multilayer moiré materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moiré scale due to the interference of different misaligned moiré periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures.

Abstract: The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.

Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution < 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.

Motivation: 先进逻辑晶体管需要一种能够同时满足亚纳米级等效氧化层厚度（EOT）、低漏电、高温工艺兼容性、宽泛的阈值电压（Vth）可调性以及高可靠性这五大严苛要求的栅极介电材料。然而，传统的high-k材料体系难以同时满足所有这些要求。

Method: 研究人员制备并测试了基于Hf/Zr的栅极叠层，具体为HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2（HZH）超晶格结构，并在其中嵌入了3Å的Al2O3偶极子层（HZHA）。他们通过700°C氮气退火和负偏压温度稳定性（NBTS）测试，来评估其电学性能和可靠性。

Result: 1. HZH超晶格实现了7.3Å的EOT，优于传统HfO2的8.5Å，且漏电相当。
2. HZHA结构在实现超过200mV的平带电压（Vfb）漂移（实现多Vth设计）的同时，获得了8.4Å的EOT，优于标准HfO2/Al2O3叠层的9.0Å，打破了传统偶极子的性能权衡。
3. HZHA结构表现出与标准HA叠层相当的可靠性（Vfb漂移分别为87mV和97mV）。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实，HZHA（在HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2超晶格中嵌入Al2O3偶极子）是一种兼容RMG工艺、可调谐Vth、具有低EOT的介电质平台，能够支持逻辑器件在1纳米节点之后继续微缩。

Abstract: Advanced logic transistors require gate dielectrics that achieve sub-nanometer equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), suppress leakage, and satisfy three key requirements: (i) compatibility with RMG-like high-temperature processing, (ii) sufficient Vth tunability for multi-Vth design, and (iii) high device reliability. However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.

Motivation: 传统上，二维（2D）材料的光学响应是通过ab initio（从头算）方法使用平面波计算的，且没有区分最重要的轨道贡献，这种方法计算成本高昂。

Conclusion: 该极简模型是一个很好的出发点，可以用数值计算成本较低的方式，在仅有少数能带的过渡金属硫族化合物（TMDC）中，进一步包含多体效应和自旋轨道耦合（SOC）。

Abstract: The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been customarily calculated ab initio using plane waves and without separating the most important orbitals contributions. In the family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, we take advantage of the mostly d-orbital content of the Bloch bands around the semiconductor gap to reduce the calculation of the linear and quadratic optical susceptibilities to a very minimal model. Such a simple approach reproduces well first principles calculations and could be the starting point for the inclusion of many-body effects and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in TMDCs with only a few energy bands in a numerically inexpensive way.

Abstract: We present a theory of the graphene nanoslide, a fundamental device for graphene straintronics that realizes a single pseudogauge barrier. We solve the scattering problem in closed form and demonstrate that the nanoslide gives rise to a hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity in the bipolar regime, and hosts one-dimensional transverse channels. The latter can be tuned using a bottom gate between valley chiral or counterpropagating modes, as well as one-dimensional flatbands. Hence, the local density of states near the barrier depends strongly on the gate voltage with a tunable sublattice and electron-hole asymmetry. In the presence of electron-electron interactions, the nanoslide allows for in-situ tuning between a chiral and ordinary Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.

Motivation: 该研究的动机是在没有外部磁场的情况下，为量子点约瑟夫森结建立自旋极化的条件。先前的工作集中在奇宇称的安德里夫自旋量子比特，而本研究则转向分析偶宇称的安德里夫对量子比特。

Method: 该研究使用零带宽近似、数值重整化群以及变分计算来求解所提出的模型。

Result: 研究发现，电子间的相互作用会将Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) 态的成分混入安德里夫束缚态（ABS），从而在自旋轨道耦合存在时显著增强自旋跃迁。这使得ABS对局部磁场波动变得敏感。在强相互作用下，电荷、自旋和电感跃迁都可能变得很强。

Conclusion: 该研究的结果对安德里夫对量子比特的退相干有重要影响，因为增强的自旋跃迁使其对磁噪声更加敏感。然而，强相互作用下增强的跃迁也为实现自旋控制和量子转导提供了新的途径。

Abstract: We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \sim 2Δ$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction.

Abstract: In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.

Abstract: We predict a new class of topological electronic crystals in bilayer graphene-Mott insulator heterostructures. Interlayer charge transfer creates a charge neutral electron hole bilayer, in which itinerant carriers in graphene interact attractively with localized carriers from a flat Hubbard band. In the heavy fermion limit and dilute limit, this interplay leads to symmetry breaking crystalline phases stabilized not only by pure repulsion, but also by interlayer Coulomb attraction shaped by band topology. Using comprehensive Hartree Fock calculations, we uncover triangular, honeycomb, and kagome charge orders hosting different quantized anomalous Hall effects at moderate interlayer attraction.

Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.

Abstract: Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.

Abstract: Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.

Abstract: We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect holds fundamental importance in topological physics and technological promise for electronics. It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.

Abstract: Ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order in solids is critical for the development of future terahertz data processing. A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by Néel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector $\mathbf{L}$ by $\pm$90° at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics.

Abstract: Controllable quasiparticle radiation in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for efficient carrier recombination, tunable emission, and modulation of valley polarization which are strongly determined by both the density and nature of underlying excitonic species. Conventional chemical doping techniques, however, often hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states (exciton and trion) due to unfavorable interactions between dopant and 2D materials. In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies.

Abstract: Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.

Abstract: We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.

Abstract: Two-band Hamiltonians provide a typical description of topological band structures, in which the eigenfunctions can be characterized by a %Bloch vector field whose winding number that defines an integer topological invariant. This winding number is quantized and protected against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Bloch vector and its winding number can be directly related to the gradient of the energy dispersion. Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector. This implies a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their underlying topological structures.

TL;DR: 本文通过μSR技术研究了一种镍氧化物（1313-La3Ni2O7）在压力下的磁性，发现压力会抑制其磁序。研究结果将其定位为连接双层和三层镍氧化物的中间体，并揭示了电子关联强度与超导电性之间可能存在的联系。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Ruddlesden-Popper系列镍氧化物的磁基态至关重要，因为这类材料在高压下会转变为超导体，其内部存在的竞争性电子序可能是理解超导配对机理的关键。

Method: 研究人员使用了μSR（μ子自旋旋转/弛豫）技术，在常压和静水压力条件下，研究了交替单层-三层相的La3Ni2O7（1313-La3Ni2O7）的磁性，并将其与双层和三层体系进行了比较分析。

Result: 研究发现，1313相在约123K时会发生类一级相变的磁序转变。施加静水压力会抑制其磁序（抑制速率约-3.9 K/GPa）。通过与相关材料体系的比较，研究揭示了一个系统性趋势：从双层、单层-三层到三层镍氧化物，其电子关联强度逐渐减弱。

Conclusion: 这种电子关联强度的层级关系表明，在双层（2222）相中观察到的更高超导转变温度，可能与其更强的电子关联特性密切相关。该研究将交替单层-三层结构的1313-La3Ni2O7定位为连接双层和三层Ruddlesden-Popper化合物磁性的中间环节。

Abstract: Understanding the magnetic ground state of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates is crucial, as these materials exhibit superconductivity under high pressure and host competing electronic orders that may play a key role in the pairing mechanism. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.

TL;DR: 通过在Kagome材料CaPd5中进行元素替换，本研究发现了一类新的Kagome超导体CaMxPd5-x（M = Nb, V），其中CaNb5的超导转变温度最高，达到10.1 K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kagome晶格材料因其独特的几何结构而展现出丰富的物理现象，激发了研究人员设计具有较高超导转变温度的新型Kagome超导体的兴趣。

Method: 研究以CaPd5为原型结构，通过第一性原理计算系统地研究了CaMxPd5-x（M = Nb, V）合金的稳定性、电声子耦合以及超导特性，并运用对称性指标方法分析了其拓扑性质。

Result: 研究发现CaNb5、CaV5、CaNb2Pd3和CaV2Pd3是动态稳定的非磁性金属。其中，CaNb5表现出强电声子耦合，超导转变温度（Tc）为10.1 K，在压力下可升至12.8 K。其他几种材料的Tc较低。研究还系统地分类了CaNb5的拓扑和节点特征。

Conclusion: 研究证明，在Kagome材料CaPd5中用Nb和V进行替代是设计高Tc超导体的有效途径，为探索Kagome体系中的拓扑超导性提供了新视角，并为发现新超导材料提供了指导。

Abstract: Materials featuring kagome lattices have attracted significant research interest due to their unique geometric frustration, which gives rise to rich physical phenomena such as non-trivial topology, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity. In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自旋三重态超导体的自旋磁化率，并展示了如何通过其在不同磁场下的行为（特别是奈特位移）来区分材料中不同的超导序参量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自旋三重态超导体中，准确确定其超导序参量的自旋构型是一个核心问题。现有的奈特位移测量是探测该构型的有力工具，但需要一个系统的理论框架来解释其在零磁场及有限磁场下的行为，并借此区分不同的超导态。

Method: 作者首先回顾了零磁场下的静态自旋磁化率和普适的零温求和规则。然后，他们通过半经典的准粒子能量多普勒频移将磁场效应引入计算，从而系统地分析了磁化率（包括奈特位移）随外加磁场的变化。

Result: 研究发现，零温求和规则对各向异性费米面也同样适用。更重要的是，自旋磁化率的磁场依赖性可作为探测超导能隙节点方向和d矢量动量依赖性的灵敏探针。将此框架应用于具体的UTe$_2$材料时，该方法能有效区分其不同的不可约表示。

Conclusion: 本文建立了一个理论框架，将奈特位移和磁化率的磁场依赖性与自旋三重态超导体的微观属性（如d矢量构型和能隙结构）联系起来。这为实验上区分和鉴定如UTe$_2$等材料中复杂的超导态提供了强有力的理论指导。

Abstract: We analyze the spin susceptibility of spin-triplet superconductors from the zero-field to finite-field regimes, with emphasis on its implications for Knight-shift measurements. In the zero-field limit, we review the general expression for the static spin susceptibility and highlight the universal zero-temperature sum rule, $\sum_i χ_{ii}(T=0)=2χ^N$, which constrains the residual susceptibility components for any triplet state. Using representative isotropic, helical, and chiral $\vec{d}$-vectors, we illustrate how the Knight shift encodes the spin configuration of the order parameter and show that the sum rule remains robust even for anisotropic Fermi surfaces. We then incorporate magnetic field effects through a semiclassical Doppler shift of quasiparticle energies in the vortex state. The resulting field dependence of the susceptibility - including both longitudinal (Knight-shift) and transverse magnetic susceptibility components - provides a sensitive probe of nodal directions and the momentum dependence of the $\vec{d}$-vector. Applying this framework to UTe$_2$, we demonstrate how the distinct irreducible representations allowed by orthorhombic symmetry can be differentiated by their field-dependent susceptibility.

TL;DR: 本文研究了两种基于约瑟f森涡旋的环形移位寄存器，发现均匀寄存器能在不破坏信息的前提下，以低于Landauer极限的能耗进行操作；而非均匀寄存器由于结构上的不连续性，能耗显著更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在探索基于约瑟夫森涡旋的新型计算元件的能量效率和信息传播特性，特别是为了实现低功耗甚至可逆计算。研究的动机是测试这些设备在能量耗散方面是否能突破或接近Landauer原理设定的热力学极限，从而评估其在未来高性能、低能耗计算中的应用潜力。

Method: 研究人员构建并比较了两种环形约瑟夫森涡旋移位寄存器：一种是均匀的闭环约瑟夫森传输线（JTL），另一种是混合了常规JTL和使用nSQUID（负电感超导量子干涉仪）的非均匀寄存器。他们通过测量电流-电压特性、有效电阻以及约瑟夫森涡旋的终端速度来分析其性能，并研究了这些特性如何随移动涡旋数量的变化而变化。

Result: 对于均匀寄存器，研究发现在高达约1.4 GHz的操作频率下，每次比特位移操作的能量耗散低于Landauer热力学极限（k_BTln2），这因为它不擦除信息所以并不违背Landauer原理。然而，对于包含nSQUID的非均匀寄存器，最低能量耗散约为Landauer极限的16倍。

Conclusion: 在非均匀寄存器中观察到的更高能量耗散归因于涡流的不均匀运动以及常规JTL和nSQUID部分之间的能垒。nSQUID的引入虽然旨在用于可逆计算，但在此配置中带来了能量成本。此外，使用nSQUIDs的传输线表现出独特的无损特性，其阻抗和传播速度依赖于频率，这与常规JTL不同。

Abstract: We study energy dissipation and propagation of information encoded by Josephson vortices in two types of circular shift register: a) a uniform register composed of sections of discrete Josephson transmission lines (JTL) forming a closed loop with a flux pump allowing to change the number of moving fluxon; b) a nonuniform register composed of sections of the regular JTL and sections of JTLs utilizing nSQUIDs - dc-SQUIDs with negative inductance between their arms - instead of single Josephson junctions. nSQUIDs are parametric devices with a flexible double-well potential that were proposed as components for reversible computing. For the uniform register, we demonstrate the energy dissipation per bit-shift operation below the Landauer's thermodynamic limit $E_T=k_BTln2$ up to propagation delays of ~0.7 ns, corresponding to the circular information motion with frequencies up to ~1.4 GHz. This does not contradict Landauer's minimum energy requirement for computations since information is not destroyed. For the nonuniform register, we find the minimum energy dissipation per bit-shift of about 16$E_T$ and attribute this to a nonuniform movement of vortices and energy barriers between the regular JTL and nSQUID sections. Differences of Josephson vortex propagation in both types of circular registers are discussed based on the measured current-voltage characteristics, extracted effective resistance and the terminal speed of Josephson vortices, and their dependences on the number of moving vorticies. nSQUID inductance connecting JJs to the ground leads to an unusual type of lossless discrete transmission line with frequency-dependent impedance and propagation speed, both different from the regular JTLs.

Abstract: We show that nonequilibrium spin injection into a superconductor can generate an anomalous supercurrent or induce a phase gradient, even for spin voltages below the superconducting gap. Our mechanism does not require breaking time-reversal symmetry in the effective superconducting Hamiltonian, but instead relies on nonequilibrium spin injection. We further demonstrate that superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier works predicting the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages. Our results provide a natural explanation for long-standing experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors and predict novel effects arising from spin-charge coupling, including the electrical control of anomalous phase gradients in superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling. These effects are broadly testable in a variety of materials and hybrid superconducting structures.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient-pressure in strained thin films raises the question of how superconductivity can be optimized through strain. In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.
