Many astrophysical models and beyond\nthe Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these\nobservations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark\nmatter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the\nJWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress\nstructure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on\nthe UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model\ndesigned to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits\non DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter\nspace. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section $\\propto v^{-2}$ velocity\ndependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of $\\sim$ 1 -- 500 MeV.\nFor other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section $\\propto\nv^{0},\\,v^{-4}$, and DM-electron scattering cross-section $\\propto\nv^{0},\\,v^{-2},\\,v^{-4}$), our limits are competitive with those obtained from\nother cosmological observables.

Here we fill in this gap\nin the literature by a detailed study of the evolution of the electromagnetic\nfield for both of these effects. To this end, we solve the Maxwell equations\nsupplemented by the simplest conventional constitutive equation for a\nsuperconductor, namely the London equation. We demonstrate that, contrary to\nthe expectations of Hirsch, the conventional theory does correctly describe the\ndynamics of both, the Meissner and the Becker-London effect.

In this\nwork, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire\nsuperlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called\nLorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This\nfield-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a\npronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches\nup to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE\noriginating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a\nrecord-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\\mu}mV-1{\\Omega}-1) near van\nHove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude\nlarger than all previously reported NHEs.

On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95%\nvalidity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57%\nin validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining\neffective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully\nperformed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including\nCoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models\nhave not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the\ninverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse\ndesign workflows for broader materials discovery."}

However, this region has often been\ndismissed for DM studies because of the evidence for an unexpected gamma-ray\ncomponent over astrophysical backgrounds at GeV energies, firstly discovered in\nthe data of the \\textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the so-called\nGalactic Center Excess (GCE). While this was initially considered to hint at\nGeV thermal relics, recent work supports a GCE interpretation in terms of a\nstellar population of millisecond pulsar-like sources in the Galactic bulge.\nBuilding on this preference, we re-evaluate the GC as a powerful target for\nindirect DM searches via gamma rays. This is achieved by combining adaptive\ntemplate fitting and pixel-count statistical methods to assess the role of\nsub-threshold point sources in the observed \\textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray\ncounts, while minimizing the mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission\nbackgrounds. In a fully self-consistent way, the gamma-ray data are fitted with\na mixed model comprising a DM signal and a stellar bulge, both potentially\ncontributing to the GCE. The space left for signals from weak-scale DM particle\nannihilations is quantified by extracting 95\\% C.L. upper limits on the\nannihilation cross section, which, depending on the DM density profile, result\nin stringent limits for masses $\\lesssim 300$ GeV.

In this work, we propose a novel and intuitive\nalgorithm to determine the chirality of nascent carbon caps by tracking the\nrelative shifts of six pentagons within a topological coordinate system. Based\non this algorithm, we propose three routes of pentagon shifts for the chirality\nmutations from armchair (AC) to near-AC caps, namely the transverse shift (n,n)\nto (n+1,n-1), inward shift (n,n) to (n-1), and outward shift (n,n) to (n+1,n),\ncan occur according to the energy profiles calculated based on the density\nfunction theory (DFT), providing a new perspective to explain the experimental\nabundance of near-AC SWCNTs. After that, we construct 24 representative short\ncaps and long SWCNTs with different chiralities and symmetries, and perform DFT\ncalculations to evaluate their thermodynamic stability and deformation\nbehaviors on flat Ni(111) surfaces and curved Ni55 particle, respectively. The\nresults reveal that cap topology and catalyst curvature together induce dual\ndeformations that significantly influence the formation and interface energies.\nNotably, AC and near-AC caps exhibit superior flexibility and robust energetic\nadvantages, especially the (6,6) cap with C6v symmetry.

A\nsplitting in the conduction band into two branches is observed after\nroom-temperature deposition. The splitting energy increases to approximately\n130 meV when the sample is cooled to 40 K. One branch exhibits a non-dispersive\ntwo-dimensional feature, while other one shows the characteristics of three\ndimensional bulk band dispersion. Core level spectroscopy suggests that the K\nimpurities predominantly occupy the intercalated sites within the van derWaals\ngap. The results indicate the formation of a quasi-freestandingTiSe2 layer.\nAdditionally, doping completely suppresses the periodic lattice distortion in\nthe surface region. These findings are further supported by density functional\ntheory calculations, which compare the band structure of monolayer and bulk\nTiSe2 with experimental data. Thus, the dimensional and intrinsic electronic\nproperties of 1T-TiSe2 can be controlled through the intercalation procedure\nused in this work."}

In these materials,\ncanted antiferromagnetism can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and produce a\nWeyl semimetallic state. CaMnBi$_2$ was proposed to realize this behavior below\n$T^{*}\\sim 50$ K, where anomalies in resistivity and optical conductivity were\nreported. We investigate single-crystal CaMnBi$_{2}$ using polarized and\nunpolarized neutron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the underlying crystal and magnetic\nstructures. The results show that the observed anomalies do not originate from\nspin canting or weak ferromagnetism; no measurable uniform Mn spin canting is\ndetected. Instead, CaMnBi$_2$ undergoes a coupled structural and magnetic\nsymmetry-lowering transition at $T^{*} = 46(2)$ K, from a tetragonal lattice\nwith C-type antiferromagnetism to an orthorhombic phase with unit-cell doubling\nalong the $c$ axis and minimal impact on magnetism. Analysis of superlattice\npeak intensities and lattice distortion reveals a continuous second-order\ntransition governed by a single order parameter. The refined atomic\ndisplacements correspond to a zigzag bond-order-wave (BOW) modulation of Bi-Bi\nbonds, consistent with an electronically driven Peierls-type instability in the\nDirac-electron Bi layer, long anticipated by Hoffmann and co-workers [W.~Tremel\nand R.~Hoffmann, \\textit{J.

In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat\ncapacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states\ncontinuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the\nIsing model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy\nassociated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically\nthe values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered\nsystems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally\nmeasured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$,\n$FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from\nthe classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be\nconnected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of\nhigher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of\ndoublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the\nvalues of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF\ncompounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic\nmaterials."}

This phenomenon is deeply rooted in\nsymmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel\nrectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies\ngenerally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic\nscaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT\nmicroscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the\ndiscovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as\nquantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges\nfrom the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical\nfield effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate\nthat the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over\nother possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba\nsplitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it\nunveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a\nuniversal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time\nin topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation\nrectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics."}
