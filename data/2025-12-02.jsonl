The second is a spectral cusp, defined by the coalescence of three extrema in the real-frequency spectral function $A(\\mathbf{k}, ω)$. This cusp enforces the formation of Fermi arcs and induces a \"threading\" structure in the nearby band structure, both of which are directly observable in ARPES."}

The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem."}

This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors."}

In particular, even a small amount of distortion of the lattice potential can localise otherwise-delocalised quantum states in low-dimensional electron systems, dramatically influencing their thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behaviour. Study of such electron localisation induced by an aperiodic lattice potential remains exceptionally challenging in solid-state systems, since extrinsic disorders can trivially trap electrons in potential minima near disorders, obscuring the underlying quantum-mechanical origin of localisation phenomena. Van der Waals heterostructures can provide an alternative route for explorations of the phenomena via the emergence of superlattice potentials generated by rotating and stacking individual layers. Here, we report strong signatures of electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene, where the interplay of two moiré patterns gives rise to a moiré-of-moiré superlattice with distinct regions of moiré-periodic and moiré-aperiodic potentials. Remarkably, our measurements reveal the presence of double moiré-induced bands and high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, which are direct reflections of the periodic region with two constituent moiré patterns, and a superimposed anomalous hysteretic signal attributable to the aperiodic region. The data strongly suggest that electron wave functions are partially localised driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential. Our work provides insight into the effects of spatially inhomogeneous lattice potentials on the low-dimensional electronic states and introduces a promising approach to control electron localisation for practical applications in solid-state devices."}

We validated our solver against APBS for a spherical cavity, and used RNA-based structures to perform a thorough study of the different algorithmic choices, and to test our implementation. We found that the best alternative to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation was using a Newton-Raphson method where the nonlinearity was gradually introduced with a cubic approximation in the first iteration. Newton-Raphson was also the best method to find the optimal relaxation factor, reducing the number of iterations by 40%.

Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic molecules regularly arranged on the surface of a thin ferromagnetic layer enable resonant coupling of propagating spin waves with the dynamics of the molecules' magnetic moments, opening a gap in the transmission spectrum up to 150 MHz. The gap, its width, and frequency can be controlled by an external magnetic field or the arrangement of molecules on the ferromagnetic surface. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments of molecules or clusters of molecules allows for control of the gap's position and width.

Yet the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation remain poorly understood due to the challenges in directly observing IAEs. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we certify that the IAEs in electride La3In (Tc = 9.4 K) exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. With the finite-depth potential well model, we trace that IAEs originate from electronic states near the Fermi level located above potential barriers, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, triggering superconductivity. ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling. Our findings resolve the long-standing ambiguity regarding the electronic nature of IAEs, elucidate their enhancing superconductivity in the phonon-mediated mechanism, and provide a foundation for exploring advanced electride-based superconductors."}

Motivated by this, we survey weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) models that can fit the GCE while satisfying relic-density, direct-detection (DD), and indirect-detection (ID) bounds. We group candidates into hadronic (Higgs portals; simplified scalar/vector mediators), leptonic ($U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$), and mixed ($U(1)_{B-L}$, $Z$-portal) classes. Across all cases, present DD and dwarf-spheroidal $γ$-ray limits exclude wide regions, leaving mainly narrow resonant funnels with $m_{\\rm DM}\\!\\simeq\\! m_{\\rm med}/2$ and portal couplings $\\ll 1$. In hadronic setups, scalar and vector Higgs portals survive only in a thin strip near $m_h/2\\simeq62.5$ GeV with portal couplings $\\sim 10^{-4}$, while the Dirac Higgs and $Z$ portals are essentially excluded. The UV-complete vector Higgs portal retains resonant bands whose viable portal strength depends on the mixing angle. Simplified scalars allow small windows for complex-scalar or vector DM; Dirac DM is strongly disfavored, whereas a pseudoscalar with Dirac DM remains viable over a broader parameter range. For a simplified $Z'$ mediator, a pure vector coupling leaves only a marginal region, while pure axial is excluded by DD/ID bounds. In leptonic scenarios, inverse-Compton emission is essential: $L_μ-L_e$ (and, to a lesser extent, $B\\!-\\!L$) fits the GCE with near-thermal cross sections, while $L_μ-L_τ$ is disfavored.

We develop a quantitative magneto-mechanically coupled phase-field model for the Fe-C system that couples a CALPHAD-based chemical free energy with demagnetization-field magnetostatics and microelasticity. The model reproduces single- and multi-particle evolution during the alpha to gamma inverse transformation at 1023 K under external fields up to 20 T, including ellipsoidal morphologies observed experimentally at 8 T. Chemically driven growth is isotropic; a magnetic interaction introduces an anisotropic driving force that elongates gamma precipitates along the field into ellipsoids, while elastic coherency promotes faceting, yielding elongated cuboidal or ``brick-like\" particles under combined magneto-elastic coupling. Growth kinetics increase with C content, and decrease with field strength and misfit strain. Multi-particle simulations reveal dipolar interaction-mediated coalescence for field-parallel neighbors and ripening for field-perpendicular neighbors. Incorporating field-dependent diffusivity from experiment slows kinetics as expected; a first-principles-motivated anisotropic diffusivity correction is estimated to be small (<2%).

Unlike thin films with electromagnetic avalanches at km/s speeds, we observe velocities of 15--25 m/s, which are orders of magnitude slower. Analysis of characteristic timescales reveals that these avalanches are governed by local heating and limited heat dissipation through the adhesive layer, establishing a fundamentally different, thermally limited propagation regime. The threshold field for avalanche nucleation decreases with temperature, contrary to the increasing trend in thin films with efficient cooling - a behavior consistent with slow heat removal and thermal runaway in our system. All observed avalanches exhibit universal normalized velocity-distance scaling despite varying morphologies, confirming the robustness of thermal control. These findings reveal that bulk superconductors with poor thermal coupling operate in a previously uncharacterized avalanche regime, with direct implications for flux stability and quench protection in NbTi-based magnets, as well as a broader understanding of thermomagnetic instabilities in technological superconductors."}

To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we study several systems in and out of equilibrium, including Model A, Model B, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We outline procedures for computing physical observables such as the critical exponents, correlation functions, and dynamic linear response, and provide our implementation as open source code."}

The mechanism raises the possibility that a vacuum that is stable against quantum tunneling can be vulnerable to ``astrophysical'' processes."}

When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals.

Very recently, the quasicrystal (QC) was proposed as a possible platform to realize AM. However, the existence of AM in QCs still lacks vigorous evidence. In this work, we adopt the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to investigate the magnetic phases in the half-filled Hubbard models in various 2D bipartite QCs, and always obtain Néel ordered states. While the Néel states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the Néel states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding Néel state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively. For example, our results yield AM for the two $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QCs and FM for the $D_5$-symmetric Penrose QC at half-filling. Our results provide a solid foundation for experimental investigations and potential applications of different classes of magnetism in QCs."}

For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides."}

To turn this stream of images into a usable dataset, each pattern must be indexed before integration and merging can proceed. In practice, diffraction patterns may contain only a small number of reliable peaks, be contaminated by background or spuriously detected reflections, or arise from crystals with highly skewed unit cells. These factors make indexing unstable in the small-N regime. We introduce a robust indexing algorithm tailored to this setting. We formulate indexing as a symmetry-aware lattice decoding problem and design a loss that explicitly incorporates lattice symmetries while trimming outlier peaks that are inconsistent with any plausible orientation. We combine this objective with a reciprocal-space basis reparameterization that stabilizes decoding for skewed or poorly conditioned lattices, and we develop a dedicated small-N objective mode that couples refined peak scoring with a method to recover orientations from very few reflections. The resulting method is memory-efficient and suitable for robust indexing. We evaluate our approach on three protein datasets from the Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank collected at XFEL facilities, using identical preprocessing and unit-cell information across methods. Across all datasets, our algorithm matches or outperforms established indexers such as XGANDALF and TORO, with particularly large gains for patterns with few indexed peaks and for crystals with skewed unit cells. While slower, our method is extremely memory-efficient, and its structure allows high-parallelism on CPUs or larger batch sizes on GPUs. These results show that exploiting lattice structure, symmetry, and small-N-aware search yields substantial improvements in indexing robustness."}

While the defect possesses a high-spin ground state, there is a lack of evidence of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), a key ingredient for optical spin initialization and readout.

Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems."}

The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.

Due to their topological properties, axion couplings to gauge bosons are independent of the gauge symmetry reduction mechanism and the background geometry -- they only depend on the embedding of the SM into the UV gauge group. There are two kinds of axions in this class of theories: axions coming from gauge fields in the bulk and axions localised on the boundaries. The axion-photon coupling for the bulk axions coincide with the results from 4-dimensional GUTs, where axions which couple to photons necessarily couple also to QCD. The brane-localised axions can couple to photons independently of the QCD coupling, but if gauge couplings are approximately unified, the axions get large masses from unsuppressed instantons on the boundaries. This means that the ratio $g_{aγγ}/m_a$ is below (or equal to) the QCD axion value for all axions in orbifold GUTs, as is the case for unified theories in 4d."}

Optical phonons probe bond-scale exchange modulation and short-range spin correlations, whereas long-wavelength acoustic modes couple to uniform strain fields and are sensitive to the renormalization of the macroscopic elastic tensor associated with long-range magnetic order. Experimentally accessing these low-energy acoustic excitations in low-dimensional crystals is challenging due to their low energies and the small lateral dimensions of exfoliated samples. Here, we employ angle-resolved Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering spectroscopy to investigate the surface acoustic phonon spectrum of exfoliated NiPS3 thin films across their antiferromagnetic transition temperature. Our results show a single Rayleigh surface mode whose phase velocity exhibits a pronounced 5.5% softening upon cooling through the Neel temperature. This anomaly reflects a giant magnetoelastic renormalization of the long-wavelength elastic constants triggered by the onset of zigzag antiferromagnetic order. First-principles calculations of the full elastic tensor, combined with continuum finite-element modelling of the NiPS3/SiO2/Si heterostructure, reproduce both the Rayleigh-wave dispersion and its magnetic-order-induced shift. The obtained results reveal how microscopic exchange interactions shape macroscopic mechanical properties in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors, providing a basis for lattice-controlled magnetism and magnetically tunable phononic, magnonic, and strain-mediated spintronic device concepts."}

The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe.

However, due to the gradient-direction conflict during the optimization of the coupled strongly nonlinear Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations, phase-field-based PINNs have not been extended to three-phase flows with phase change. Furthermore, the interface thickness is known to be artificially magnified, whether in numerical or artificial intelligence-based simulations, reducing accuracy. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) that solves an energy-stable phase-field model for three-phase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware residual-adaptive architecture to mitigate spectral bias and to automatically detect and model sharp interfaces, and a learnable local artificial-viscosity term to stabilize the algorithm near steep gradients.

With density functional molecular dynamics simulations we studied the behavior of ammonium polyhydride compounds with stoichiometries of NH$_7$, NH$_9$, NH$_{10}$, NH$_{11}$, NH$_{14}$, NH$_{20}$, and NH$_{24}$ which were predicted with crystal structure search methods to be metastable at 100-300~GPa. For every compound, we performed simulations at a range of temperatures (and for several compounds, pressures) covering the solid, superionic and liquid phases. We show that when heated, high pressure ammonium polyhydride compounds exhibit hydrogen superionic diffusion. We demonstrate a number of metrics by which the solid-to-superionic and superionic-to-liquid transitions can be detected from simulation data, including changes in the internal energy and pressure, formation of new chemical species, and atomic diffusion rates. We find that both the solid-to-superionic and the superionic-to-liquid transitions decrease in temperature as proton fraction increases. These trends indicate that above a proton fraction of $\\sim$0.97, ammonium hydride structures are likely to directly melt instead of first exhibiting a superionic phase. Our observed melting trend further indicates that at the extreme conditions of ice giant interiors, hydrogen rich ammonium hydrides such as those studied in this work would exist predominantly as liquids rather than exhibiting a superionic phase."}

Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements.

Nanoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu, Fe, and Si demonstrate the initiation and propagation of dislocations and cracks, and these results are reproduced by the finite element method in excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Mesoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu further demonstrate the ability of the method to capture size-dependent brittle and ductile behavior.

In this study, a systematic thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy is presented to synthesize centimeter-scale WS2 thin films by sulfurizing tungsten (W) precursors in a controlled sulfur vapor environment. High-purity sputtered W thin films on SiO2/Si and W foils were sulfurized at temperatures between 400 and 1000 C, with Raman spectroscopy identifying 800 C as the optimal growth temperature. Under these conditions, the films exhibit the characteristic E12g (349.7 cm-1) and A1g (416.8 cm-1) modes with narrow full-width at half-maximum values, indicative of high crystallinity and controlled thickness. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy collectively validate the creation of stoichiometric, layered WS2 with significantly enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness when utilizing sputtered W thin films in contrast to W foils. Leveraging this optimized process, WS2 films grown on W foils were transferred onto target substrates, including indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, using a PMMA-assisted wet-transfer method that preserves structural integrity over large areas. Schottky-barrier solar cells with an Au/WS2/ITO architecture fabricated from these films deliver a short-circuit current density of 7.91 mA cm-2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.495 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.45 percent.

The UV-driven structural dynamics of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) are investigated using real-time TDDFT simulations, revealing that under the electron and hole excitation, the distortion of the inorganic framework (PbI) is primarily driven by the electron occupation of Pb-p and I-p antibonding states, whereas in the hole case, it is mainly governed by the direct cooling induced distortion. We also find that UV accelerates the rotation of MA+ molecules. Further, a BDO molecule is introduced as a passivant, which suppresses structural distortions and provides multi-phonon channels to dissipate carrier cooling energy. Experimental results confirm the UV-protective role of BDO, with suppressed PbI2 formation and improved device stability. These results clarify the mechanism of the UV-induced degradation in the MAPbI3 perovskite and further elucidate how passivation molecules enhance UV stability."}

The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems."}

While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control."}

Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for ultrabroadband MFC generation using a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator. The small resonator volume, combined with a slow-wave transducer, yields high intra-resonator power density, driving the system deep into the bistable regime where parametric excitation of propagating spin waves facilitates comb formation. Our approach yields more than 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth, with spacing continuously tunable via a two-tone external drive, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at relatively low power. The platform is ultra-compact (4-6 orders of magnitude smaller in size than conventional YIG sphere resonators), fully scalable, and highly tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties through magnetic bias and pump manipulation. These results establish a new paradigm for frequency comb technology, unlocking transformative opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing."}

The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem."}

We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\\infty)\\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy.

To address this, we elucidate how dopant adatoms deposited on Cu and Ag surfaces become incorporated into the metal and identify periodic trends from early to late transition metals (TMs) using density functional theory. Adatoms diffuse nearly freely across terraces, as diffusion barriers are small, whereas direct incorporation into terraces is unfavourable. In line with conventional wisdom, step edges and kink sites strongly facilitate dopant incorporation, confirming their critical role in alloy formation. Attachment of adatoms to steps and kinks from the lower terrace is favoured. Incorporation then proceeds either from this attached state or when adatoms approach a step edge from above, where reactions often proceed without barrier. Incorporation barriers are generally lower for early and central TMs, increase towards late TMs, and are slightly higher on Cu than on Ag surfaces. Repulsive interactions between Pd adatoms and dopants explain the experimental observation that a dopant-rich brim on the upper terrace of Cu surfaces inhibits incorporation from above. In contrast, attractive interactions, as found for Ru, anchor diffusing adatoms (even on terraces) and promote the formation of adatom islands, yet hinder incorporation next to the dopant and may impede the growth of embedded dopant clusters. By rationalising periodic trends and experimental observations, we show how specific surface sites and adatom--dopant interactions shape dopant incorporation, offering guidance on the surface environments most conducive to SAA synthesis for different dopant elements."}

The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy > 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control."}

Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems."}

In this study, we discovered intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains in chemically ordered ferroelectric Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$ using in-situ transmission electron microscopy with dark-field imaging. Observation results demonstrate that electric polarization can fluctuate around the [111] direction despite the formation of long-range ordered rhombohedral domains, which results in unique weak relaxor properties.

Conventional reactive force fields such as ReaxFF require system-specific parametrization, while universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) exhibit limited sampling efficiency. This paper introduces a novel simulation framework integrating a uMLIP with a time-dependent bond-boost scheme. The bias potential increases monotonically with time, and the use of a unified parameter set across reaction classes enables consistent acceleration without system-specific tuning. For radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, the proposed framework reproduces characteristic trends, such as linear molecular-weight growth with conversion, initiator-concentration scaling, and relative monomer reactivity trends. For step-growth polycondensation of nylon-6,6, it captures the characteristic sharp increase in molecular weight at high conversion rates, consistent with experimental behavior. For epoxy curing at a copper substrate, it reveals interfacial ring-opening and cross-linking events, consistent with spectroscopic evidence of Cu-O-C bond formation. Overall, coupling uMLIPs with time-dependent bond boost enables practical and transferable simulations of polymerization and curing processes. The proposed framework reliably resolves mechanistic pathways and relative reactivity, offering molecular-level insights into polymer growth and interfacial adhesion."}

For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides."}

In this work, we investigate a model based on two interacting sterile neutrinos and a scalar singlet. The heavier of the neutrinos is produced in the early Universe by the interplay of oscillations and the new interactions in the dark sector and constitutes the dominant component of dark matter. If the Yukawa matrix that describes the interactions of the steriles with the scalar is not diagonal, the heavier state can decay to three light sterile neutrinos. In contrast to the usual scenario, this leads to an all massive final state without radiation-like particles. We identify the part of the parameter space where these decays can lead to a reduction of S$_8$ at a level that matches observations. We then confront this region with the requirements of reproducing the observed relic density, as well as existing constraints from X-ray searches and Lyman-$α$ forest data."}

These MLIPs employ three different architectures (graph neural networks, graph network simulators, and graph transformers) with varying training datasets.

From all tested models, three top performers arise; `MACE-MP-0a', `fairchem_OMAT', and `Orb-v3', with average error across metrics and materials of 41%, 44%, and 47%, respectively.

By computing the Gibbs free energies of B2, hcp, fcc, and bcc solid solutions, we construct the Fe-Si phase diagram applicable to the Earth's inner core. Our results reveal a pronounced miscibility gap between hcp and B2 Fe-Si, with the two phases coexisting over the compositional range of 6-11 wt% Si at 6000 K. The B2 Fe-Si alloy exhibits strong single-crystal shear anisotropy (22.9% at 6000 K) compared to the nearly isotropic hcp phase (0.6%), and yields a shear wave velocity (3.73 km/s) and Poisson's ratio consistent with seismological observations.

The method relies on calculating the extrema of a modified potential function for the scalar field undergoing the transition. The shape of this function, which we refer to as the ``pseudopotential'', changes with the wall velocity, and if the dependence of the fluid temperature on scalar gradients is weak -- which is confirmed to hold with high accuracy in concrete examples -- the difference in pseudopotential between two appropriate extrema gives the net outward pressure acting on the bubble wall. It then follows that the correct terminal bubble velocities are those that lead to degenerate minima in the pseudopotential. This allows to compute bubble velocities without having to solve the equation of motion of the scalar field, and in contrast to other methods this can be done without relying on simplified equations of state for the plasma or without choosing a specific ansatz for the scalar field profile. We illustrate the method in a singlet extension of the Standard Model, computing the net outward pressure as a function of the wall velocity. We confirm the dip in outward pressure found in the literature for hybrid bubbles, which implies that stationary deflagrations are stable, while their detonation counterparts are unstable."}

Among the various scalable and industry-compatible metal halide perovskite deposition techniques, co-evaporation stands out as particularly well-suited for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells due to its ability to conformally cover textured silicon bottom cells. Solution-processed [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz) is commonly used as a hole-transporting material for co-evaporated metal halide perovskites. However, we show that it covers the textured surface of silicon bottom cells unevenly, impacting the film growth and leading to the formation of residual PbI2 at the buried interface. The present study reveals via X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) that a CsCl seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation across the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface, even in the areas with a thin MeO-2PACz layer, thereby preventing the formation of interfacial PbI2 and leading to larger apparent grains. The improvement of the metal halide perovskite film quality on the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface and the bulk perovskite film led to 30.3% (29.7% certified) efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. The present work highlights the importance of a seed layer for a robust growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite and represents an important milestone for the transfer of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells from laboratory to industry."}

Here, we propose a time-varying electric circuit to address the question of whether the quantum LZT can occur in classical systems. Although the underlying differential equation of motion is quite different from the Schrödinger equation and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of the proposed circuit is not linear, the probability of the LZT in circuits (circuit LZT for short), based on our new definition for norm-unconserved systems, still follows the laws of the LZT in quantum systems, co-determined by the linear sweeping rate $α'$ and the frequency gap $Δ$, i.e., approaching the analytical value $\\exp(-πΔ^2/2α')$, regardless of whether the coupling is reciprocal or nonreciprocal. The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process. Our proposal provides a general method for simulating time-dependent quantum models using time-varying electric circuits, which has been lacking in previous studies, and paves the way for studying more complicated LZT and other dynamical phenomena in circuits and other classical systems."}

Our analysis explores the dependence of complexity growth on string velocity, chemical potential, temperature, and the number of flavors. Results show maximum complexity growth for stationary strings, decreasing with string velocity. At zero chemical potential, complexity growth is largest in the pure gluon system and reduces with the addition of quark flavors. Increasing temperature and chemical potential consistently enhance complexity growth. Furthermore, complexity growth exhibits multi-valued behavior in regions corresponding to first-order transitions and single-valued behavior in crossover regimes, indicating that complexity can serve as a probe for phase transitions."}

By threading magnetic flux through disconnected polygonal plaquettes and applying local entangling unitary transformations, we map plaquettes onto families of ABF models in one, two, and three dimensions. This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations. In these TRS-broken constructions, the CLSs host localized circulatory currents whose magnitude depends on the applied flux. We further extend the framework to lattices with coexisting flat and dispersive bands, illustrating cases with both orthogonal and non-orthogonal CLSs. Our results provide a controlled route for generating dispersionless lattices supporting flux-induced local currents."}

Such photonic materials can be fabricated by a lithography-free defect-driven etching process, where threading dislocations intrinsic to heteroepitaxy form nanoscale channels that facilitate etchant transport through NID layers. Here, we report the first three-dimensional characterisation of porous GaN-on-Si DBRs fabricated in this methodology with different ECE voltages, using serial-section tomography in a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). These datasets reconstruct the pore morphology as etching proliferates through the alternating Si-doped/NID layer stack. Volumetric reconstruction enabled us to enhance the established `kebab' model for defect-driven etching by proposing a `cascade' model where etchant cascades through the material via vertical etching down nanopipes and horizontal etching across pores, forming complex networks directly related to the pathways taken. This accounts for premature nanopipe termination and discontinuities in nanopipe formation, where dislocations are observed to activate and deactivate individually. Statistical analysis of individual etching behaviour, across all dislocations for each tomograph, revealed a greater tendency to form continuous structures that follow conventional kebab behaviour at higher ECE voltages. We propose that higher ECE voltages alter the probability of dislocation etching relative to doped layer etching, thereby empowering morphological optimization through improved mechanistic understanding of ECE."}

In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes."}

To this end, we evaluate the generalized form factors and parton distribution functions derived, respectively, from the first Mellin moments and the forward limit pion GPDs, in comparison to existing experimental data, recent lattice QCD simulations, and JAM global QCD analyses. We find that the pion parton distribution functions derived from the pion GPDs have excellent agreement with the experimental data and JAM analysis at renormalization scale $μ^2 =$ 4 and 27 GeV$^2$.

Sharp tip specimens were prepared from Pt and PtPd alloy wires by electrochemical polishing and Focused Ion Beam annular milling, with the hemispherical apex serving as a model for nanoscale catalyst surfaces. The samples were exposed to the reactive atmosphere in a dedicated reaction chamber and subsequently analyzed using atom probe tomography. Effective oxide thicknesses and three-dimensional surface morphology were quantitatively evaluated. A pronounced decrease in oxide thickness was observed during the first cooling and second heating cycles, particularly below 200 C, indicating reversible redox behavior on both Pt and PtPd alloy surfaces. This behavior correlates with the inverse hysteresis of NO conversion measured for both systems, suggesting that the redox reversibility is driven primarily by reaction kinetics rather than thermodynamic stability."}

These reactions are driven by the non-local chemistry arising from the cation-anion size disparity, distinctly different from the He insertion reaction with A2B-type compounds. The large size differences between Na+ and X- enable structures that can effectively host He insertions through volume and inter-atomic distance disproportionation. Furthermore, the insertion of He atoms can significantly relieve the elevated Madelung energy that builds up in NaX under high pressure. This energy increase arises from structural transitions driven by cation-anion size disparity, which are necessary for reducing volume under pressure. The insertion of He allows the reduction of the total volume under high pressure without increasing the Madelung energy. Our predicted compounds and stability analysis reveal a new example of He reactivity governed not by local chemical bond formation, but by long-range electrostatic interactions."}

Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances.

Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge."}

These models generalize the $π$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models."}

Yet the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation remain poorly understood due to the challenges in directly observing IAEs. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we certify that the IAEs in electride La3In (Tc = 9.4 K) exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. With the finite-depth potential well model, we trace that IAEs originate from electronic states near the Fermi level located above potential barriers, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, triggering superconductivity. ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling. Our findings resolve the long-standing ambiguity regarding the electronic nature of IAEs, elucidate their enhancing superconductivity in the phonon-mediated mechanism, and provide a foundation for exploring advanced electride-based superconductors."}

This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft.

We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $α$-Sn for band engineering.

While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control."}

This field interacts with baryons and leptons via a vector-current coupling and, by construction, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Accordingly, the theory also exhibits a spontaneous violation of Lorentz invariance, effectively realizing a Bumblebee model. In this picture, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_B$ global symmetry is the global phase of the Bumblebee vector and, in the broken phase, it results minimally coupled with the baryonic current, guaranteeing the violation of the baryon number. Consequently, we assume that the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone, arising from spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$, plays the role of the inflaton, leading to baryogenesis across the entire inflationary stage, up to when the inflaton decays into baryon-antilepton and antibaryon-lepton pairs through a CP-violating interaction that also violates the Lorentz symmetry. Afterwards, we address the issue of flavor oscillations among baryon and lepton fields, including the oscillation probability in the calculation of the baryon asymmetry. Remarkably, our framework predicts a non-null mixing factor even for massless fermions. This mixing acts on the spatial momenta rather than on the masses of the produced fermions, allowing larger values of the coupling constant even guaranteeing the production of light fermions. The net baryon asymmetry results accordingly modified, and may also reproduce the experimental data for allowed values of the coupling constant."}

Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of the layered semiconductor Ta2NiS5, revealed through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory. Instead, we argue that it arises from the formation of negative trions, stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Unlike excitons, these trions form without optical pumping and persist at equilibrium, marking a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a nominally conventional semiconductor. Our findings establish Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for exploring many-body physics at surfaces and open new avenues for studying and controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems."}

Tomas Mari Surkau", "Urko Reinosa"], "title": "SU($N_c$) confinement and color $N_c$-ality", "comment": "24 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "In a recent work, we have argued that the net quark number gained by a bath of quarks and gluons upon bringing an external static quark probe, while being equal to $1$ in the high temperature, deconfined phase, is equal to $0$ or $3$ in the low temperature, confined phase, depending on the value of the quark chemical potential. This establishes a clear-cut connection between the confinement of a medium as probed by order parameters such as the Polyakov loop, and the ability of that same medium to screen the quark probe into states with the same net quark content as mesons or baryons. In this work, we extend these findings to the SU($N_c$) color group, consider color probes in various (fundamental and non-fundamental) representations, and conjecture a rationale of how these results could be recovered from a purely thermodynamic argument that shortcuts the use of the Euclidean functional framework, while emphasizing the role of color $N_c$-ality as a proxy for center symmetry within the Minkowskian framework."}

The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications."}

We will explicitly study this approach at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD, where we will discuss the cause of the violation of infrared safety, argue that it is merely an artefact of the calculation, and explain how a consistent treatment of flavour removes this violation. The most important feature of our approach is that it does not require any changes to the definition of the jet or its flavour, nor does it modify the definition of the cross section. Consequently, the predictions can be directly compared to measurements performed using the standard anti-$k_T$ jet clustering algorithm, without the need for experimental collaborations to adapt their analyses to some new, infrared-collinear-safe definition of jet flavour, as would be the case for most - if not all - solutions presented in the literature thus far."}

In the model, we incorporate a variable bond angle, which allows us to simulate the effect of the in-plane strain. In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $α$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $α$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone."}

Such Tera-Z factories can discover new elementary particles with couplings to the Z-boson that are orders of magnitude smaller than current bounds. For couplings near the currently excluded parameter regions they could produce sufficiently large samples to study the new particles' properties in detail, hence acting as a discovery and precision machine in one. Using simple analytic estimates, we quantify the dependence of the expected event yield in long-lived particle searches on the number of produced Z-bosons and on the detector dimensions. From this, we derive estimates for both the discovery reach and the measurement precision attainable at such facilities. While the precision of such estimates of course falls short of proper simulations, the analytic approach is suitable for a quick assessment of the sensitivity for a given design. We illustrate this with two examples, heavy neutral leptons and axion-like particles. Under optimistic assumptions, these could be produced in the millions and billions, respectively, effectively turning future lepton colliders into exotics factories.\n  We provide a code that quickly generates the sensitivity curves displayed in this work and can be extended to other models at https://github.com/liyuanzhen98/LLPatTeraZ."}

To do this, we impose perturbativity and unitarity constraints on the thermal effective potential to identify the portion of parameter space that admits a reliable effective field theory description. We also include the Polyakov-loop-improved finite-temperature potential for both N=3 and N=4, where N is the number of dark colors, using an approximate computation of the mediating effects. We compute the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and delineate the regions of parameter space that remain phenomenologically viable after imposing theoretical consistency conditions. We find that these constraints make uncovering a stochastic background gravitational wave signal in this scenario more challenging, even for proposed future detectors."}
