Specializing to two spatial dimensions, we derive Bogomolny-type lower bounds that relate these actions to the Chern number and show that the bounds are saturated by (anti-)holomorphic projector configurations. Along the flows, the actions decrease monotonically while the Chern number is conserved, giving a constructive route to simplify models within a fixed topological phase toward canonical, low-complexity representatives."}

Pati"], "title": "Localization transitions in an open quasiperiodic ladder", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate localization transition in an open quasiperiodic ladder where the quasiperiodicity is described by the Aubry-André-Harper model. While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order."}

The kinetic inductance scales inversely with the number of NbSe$_2$ layers, reaching 1.2 nH/$\\Box$ in the monolayer limit. Furthermore, the measured kinetic inductance exhibits a thickness-dependent crossover from clean- to dirty-limit behavior, with enhanced dirty-limit contributions emerging in the ultra-thin regime.

The gluon spectrum is computed within the Improved Opacity Expansion, which accounts for both multiple soft and single hard momentum exchanges between the hard probe and the medium. The background evolution is obtained from effective kinetic theory simulations that determine the jet quenching parameter, which in turn controls the radiation rate. We compute the radiation rate for initially under- and over-occupied systems, as well as for an expanding system undergoing hydrodynamization, which typically represents the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions. The results for these dynamical backgrounds are compared to static and thermally matched scenarios, allowing to gauge the importance of bulk expansion in the evolution of the jet cascade. Our findings show that the early stages of the bulk matter evolution in heavy-ion collisions leave a sizable imprint on the radiation pattern inside jets.

Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint.

In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science.

The interpretation of its in-plane anisotropy has remained unsettled due to structural twinning, which superimposes orthogonal magnetic responses. Here we combine controlled crystal growth with magnetization and rotational magnetometry to disentangle the effects of twinning. Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\\text{easy}}(4~\\text{T}) \\approx 1.8~μ_{\\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response. These results resolve long-standing discrepancies in reported magnetic measurements, in which in-plane metamagnetic transition fields and saturation magnetization varied significantly across previous studies. Growth experiments demonstrate that avoiding the proposed $α$-$β$ structural transition $-$ through Sb-rich flux and slower cooling $-$ systematically reduces twinning. However, powder X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis measurements show no clear evidence of a distinct $β$ phase.

Two-dimensional (2D) electrides are layered materials with cationic layers separated by 2D confined electrons that act as anions. This study reveals the unique frictional properties of these compounds and the underlying mechanisms. We establish that interlayer friction correlates with the cationic charges and sliding-induced charge redistribution. Remarkably, the 2D electride Ba2N stands out for its lower interlayer friction than graphene, despite its stronger interlayer adhesion, defying conventional tribological understanding. This anomalous behavior arises from electron redistribution as the dominant energy dissipation pathway. Combining ab initio calculations and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, we show that incommensurate twisted interfaces (2° < θ < 58°) in Ba2N achieve structural superlubricity by suppressing out-of-plane buckling and energy corrugation. Notably, a critical normal load of 2.3 GPa enables barrier-free sliding in commensurate Ba2N (θ = 0°), with an ultralow shear-to-load ratio of 0.001, suggesting the potential for superlubricity. Moreover, electron doping effectively reduces interlayer friction by controllably modulating stacking energies in 2D electrides. These findings establish 2D electrides as a transformative platform for energy-efficient tribology, enabling scalable superlubricity through twist engineering, load adaptation, or electrostatic gating. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of electron-mediated friction, with Ba2N serving a model system for cost-effective, high-performance material design."}

Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics."}

Numerical studies have found evidence for stripe-ordered states and superconductivity at strong coupling but the phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we show that one can resolve the subtle energetics of metallic, superconducting, and stripe phases using a new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions that extend hidden fermion de- terminant states to Pfaffians. We simulate several hundred electrons using fast Pfaffian algorithms allowing us to measure off-diagonal long range order. At strong coupling and low hole-doping, we find that a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails, while superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime, with |t-prime| > 0.1. At larger doping levels, we introduce momentum-space correlation functions to mitigate finite size effects that arise from weakly-bound pairs. These provide evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity at U = 4, even when t-prime = 0. Our results highlight the potential of NQS approaches, and provide a fresh perspective on superconductivity in the square lattice Hubbard model."}

We demonstrate that local distortions induced by the doped Nb atoms beyond its quantum critical composition induce a long-range ferroelectric order. The predicted dielectric properties quantitatively agree with the experimental measurements over the entire temperature range from the symmetry-broken ferroelectric phase across the phase transition to the paraelectric region.

Our research confirms the dominance of vdW effects by estimating the fraction of interlayer binding energy attributable to these interactions. We also examined how the choice of different vdW-corrected DFT functionals might influence quantitative results. Using MoS$_2$ as a reference TMD bilayer system, we found that most other TMD bilayers studied exhibit stronger interlayer bonds and greater corrugation. However, TiSe$_2$ shows a profile similar to MoS$_2$, while, interestingly, TiS$_2$, VS$_2$, and ZrS$_2$ are characterized by weaker bonding and lower corrugation than MoS$_2$. We explored relationships between various properties of TMD bilayers, with a particular focus on potential connections between tribological and electronic properties often characteristic of solid interfaces. To this end, we evaluated adhesion energies, work of separation, charge density redistributions in interface regions, differential charge densities, and corrugation. While corrugation and thus resistance to sliding generally tends to increase with the size of the chalcogen element and is typically proportional to the adhesion energy, the relationships between other structural, energetic, and electronic properties do not follow a single, well-defined trend."}

Constitutive modelling is a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between stress and strain in materials under different loading conditions. In this study, two materials (age-hardenable aluminium alloy and high-chromium martensitic steel) and two different testing methods (compression and tension) are considered to obtain the required stress-strain data. The results highlight the benefits of using symbolic regression while also discussing potential challenges."}

We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\\times U(1)\\!\\to\\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole-antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, and verify that the thin-defect approximation remains valid throughout the phenomenologically favoured region, without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking."}

While 2D ferromagnets have received significant attention with regard to predicting Curie temperatures, the treatment of 2D anti-ferromagnetism has largely been restricted to classical approaches, which typically underestimate Néel temperatures. The concept of anti-ferromagnetism can be regarded as a special case of single-$Q$ magnetic order, and for such systems the critical temperature can be calculated from the magnon dispersion using either Holstein-Primakoff (HP) bosonization or Green's function-based Random Phase Approximation (RPA). Here, we study the effects of single-ion anisotropy in general single-$Q$ systems in both the HP and RPA methods. In the case of RPA, we generalize the approach to include the Callen Decoupling (CD) correction, which has previously been shown to yield good agreement with experimental Curie temperatures for 2D ferromagnets. We compare the calculated critical temperatures of CrI$_3$ (uniaxial ferromagnet), MPS$_3$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) (uniaxial anti-ferromagnets) and CrSBr (triaxial ferromagnet) monolayers with experimental values and find that the Green's function-based methods are much more reliable than HP and that the CD decoupling appears to be more accurate than RPA if the single-ion anisotropy is large."}

While nodal line (NL) and nodal surface (NS) semimetals have been extensively studied, the realization of a material where both NL and NS coexist and are intertwined, particularly with an ideal electronic band structure, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predict via first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis a metastable boron allotrope, Porous-B$_{18}$ (space group $P6_3/m$, No.~176), as a pristine TSM hosting a NS and two straight NLs near the Fermi level. The structure, a honeycomb-like porous 3D framework, exhibits excellent dynamical, thermal (stable up to 1000~K), and mechanical stability. Its electronic band structure is remarkably clean: only the highest valence band (HVB) and the lowest conduction band (LCB) cross linearly within a large energy window of 1.84~eV, free from trivial-band interference. The nodal surface lies on the $k_z = \\pm π$ planes, protected by combined time-reversal symmetry ($T$) and twofold screw-rotational symmetry ($S_{2z}$), yielding a full-plane Kramers-like degeneracy. The two nodal lines along $K$--$H$ and $K'$--$H'$ are protected by inversion and time-reversal symmetries, carry a quantized Berry phase of $\\pm π$, and connect orthogonally to the nodal surface, forming an intertwined nodal network. Drumhead surface states on the $(1\\bar{1}0)$ surface further confirm the nontrivial topology. Porous-B$_{18}$ thus provides an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between nodal-line and nodal-surface fermions and exploring novel quantum transport phenomena."}

Among solid electrolytes for solid-state sodium batteries, NASICON-structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12 has emerged as a predominant candidate. However, its widespread implementation remains limited by suboptimal ionic conductivity in both bulk and grain boundary regions. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing swirling spray flame synthesis to produce Mg-doped NASICON solid electrolyte nanoparticles. This method facilitates efficient doping and homogeneous mixing for scalable production, resulting in core-shell non-NASICON structures with nano-scale high-entropy mixing. Notably, the atomic migration distances achieved by flame synthesis are significantly reduced compared to conventional solid-state reactions, thereby enabling reactive sintering to preserve high sinterability of nanoparticles during post-treatment processes. High-temperature sintering yields dense NASICON-structured solid electrolytes. Among those, Mg0.25NZSP exhibits an optimal ionic conductivity of 1.91 mS/cm at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.200 eV. The enhancement mechanism can be attributed to incorporation into the NASICON phase and formation of a secondary phase. The low-melting-point secondary phase significantly improves grain boundary contact to enhance grain boundary conductivity. The process achieves simultaneous enhancement of both bulk and grain boundary conduction through a single-step procedure. Comparative analysis of sintering temperatures and ionic conductivities among NASICON solid electrolytes synthesized via different methods demonstrates flame-synthesized nanoparticles offer superior performance and reduced post-treatment costs, owing to their exceptional nano-scale sinterability and uniform elemental distribution."}

Further reduction in thickness is essential for low-voltage embedded nonvolatile memory applications. Boron incorporation into AlScN (AlBScN) suppresses leakage current in films down to 40 nm, yet its ferroelectric characteristics in ultrathin films remains unexplored. This letter demonstrates robust ferroelectric switching in 10 nm sputtered AlBScN capacitors with a low coercive field and approximately two orders of magnitude lower leakage than AlScN. Notably, ferroelectric switching was observed at 2.2 MV/cm in capacitance-voltage measurements, and symmetric polarization reversal occurred near 4.6 MV/cm in positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements using 2 μs pulses. Moreover, Weibull analysis revealed a breakdown-to-coercive-field ratio (EBD/Ec) of ~2.2. These findings demonstrated AlBScN as a promising candidate for CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible ferroelectric applications with improved energy consumption and reduced leakage current."}

Magnetic susceptibility reveals canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ordering at T_N = 125 K, two compensation points (T_comp1 and T_comp2), followed by magnetization reversal with a magnetic susceptibility minimum between T_comp1 and T_comp2. Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'. Furthermore, the ordered moments of Cr and Tm in TmCrO3 exhibit a complex, non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the Tm sublattice driving the spin-reorientation transition near the compensation point. Anomalies in the lattice parameters reveal strong magnetoelastic coupling, linking structural distortions to the SRO."}

Supplementary: 2 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "By applying the conventional two-liquid model to the magnetoresistivity tensor, we reveal a record-high carrier mobility for surface states in tetradymite topological insulators ($\\sim$ 20000 cm$^2$/Vs) in both bulk crystals and thin flakes of Sn-Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S. Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators."}
