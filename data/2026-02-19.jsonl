A quantitative interpretation of emerging jet quenching measurements requires precise control over cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, which modify hard-process cross sections independently of any hot-medium dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive set of perturbative QCD baseline calculations for nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) in proton-oxygen (pO), oxygen-oxygen (OO) and neon-neon (NeNe) collisions at LHC energies. The study includes charged hadron, neutral pion, prompt photon, and electroweak-boson production computed at next-to-leading order using a broad set of recent nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). We demonstrate that CNM effects alone can induce sizeable suppressions in light-ion systems, with large associated nPDF uncertainties that currently limit the quantitative extraction of parton energy loss. To address this limitation, we explore a range of multi-cross-section ratios in which CNM effects and their uncertainties largely cancel. In particular, ratios of neutral pion $R_{OO}$ to prompt photon $R_{OO}$ or charged hadron $R_{OO}$ to $R_{pO}^2$ provide theoretically robust observables with substantially reduced nPDF uncertainties, thereby enhancing sensitivity to possible energy-loss signatures."}

While annual modulation has been well studied for decades, daily modulation due to the Earth's rotation has attracted increased attention recently due to the identification of anisotropic solid-state detector materials that yield a direction-dependent scattering rate without sacrificing the overall rate. We perform a statistical analysis of daily modulation in dark matter scattering experiments, with the goal of maximizing the statistical significance of a modulating signal in the presence of an unknown background rate, which may be either flat (non-modulating), or modulating over a 24-hour period with a known or unknown phase. In the background-dominated regime, we find that the discovery significance scales as $f_\\text{RMS} \\sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the total exposure time and $f_\\text{RMS}$ is the root-mean-square modulation amplitude; in particular, the significance continues to improve with exposure rather than saturating due to systematic uncertainties in the background rate. Using anisotropic trans-stilbene detectors for sub-GeV dark matter as a benchmark example, we provide prescriptions for optimizing the significance for a given total detector mass and location. In an example analysis using three detectors, optimizing the detector orientations can reduce the required exposure by a factor of $\\sim 5$ for a desired discovery or exclusion significance, even after profiling over an unknown modulating background phase."}

To address this limitation, rolling friction is commonly introduced as an approximation to account for particle shape effects by applying a resistive torque to spherical particles. Among existing rolling friction formulations, the spring-dashpot (S-D) type model is widely recognized for its numerical stability and realistic representation of rolling resistance. However, conventional S-D models require multiple empirical parameters that must be calibrated in an interdependent manner, leading to increased experimental effort, parameter ambiguity, and uncertainty in practical applications. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a new S-D type rolling friction model that reduces the parameter set to a single physically meaningful quantity: the critical rolling angle. Derived from theoretical considerations, this parameter characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion at particle contacts. The use of a single parameter simplifies implementation and eliminates the need for extensive calibration. Stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed model allows particles to reach a physically consistent equilibrium state without spurious rotational oscillations. For large-scale applications, the model is further integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework. Validation using DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system confirms that the proposed approach successfully reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the original particle system. Overall, this study enhances the applicability of DEM for industrial-scale simulations involving non-spherical particles."}

Realizing such flat bands has thus far relied primarily on moiré graphene superlattices or rhombohedral stacking graphene systems, both of which face challenges in reproducibility and tunability. Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands. As temperature increases, these correlated gaps collapse, signaling the thermal suppression of interaction-driven states. Continuum-model calculations confirm the formation of multiple flat minibands and reproduce the observed evolution of band reconstruction. Our results establish dielectric-patterned graphene superlattices as a robust and controllable architecture for realizing flat-band-induced correlated phenomena beyond moiré systems."}

Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,μ), to the corresponding angular fluxes, ψ(x,μ), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring <0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to <0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization."}

Large-scale tensile loading simulations are used to generate failure data across all principal stress ratios and loading orientations, facilitated by a data-driven mapping between imposed strain-rate tensors and resulting stresses. The orientation-dependent strength surface is then represented using a constrained parametric formulation in which the surface parameters vary smoothly with loading angle through a low-dimensional functional encoding. To deploy the framework, we specifically consider the case of monocrystalline graphene, which is a prototypical two-dimensional material that has been extensively characterized, both experimentally and computationally, in the literature. For defective graphene, multiple random realizations of vacancy defect distributions are used to construct a stochastic ensemble of angular strength surfaces. Because each anisotropic strength surface requires substantial atomistic sampling to construct, the resulting ensemble is inherently limited in size, motivating the use of compact encoding, dimensionality reduction, and probabilistic modeling to characterize strength variability. Dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis reveals a condensed latent representation of the fitted, encoded surfaces, where a Gaussian mixture model is employed to capture defect-induced variability, including rare outlier behaviors arising from clustered vacancy defects. Sampling from this probabilistic model enables the generation of new, physically admissible strength surfaces and the construction of confidence intervals in both parameter space and stress space.

This was an utter boon to strangeness physics investigations, and to date, more than 50 dedicated experiments in kaon photo- and electroproduction have been completed at facilities around the world, leading to a host of experimental observables that have enabled significant advances in the exploration of strongly interacting systems that decay via $s\\bar{s}$ quark pair creation. This review was designed to provide the first-ever in-depth overview of both the experimental and theoretical progress in the field of the electromagnetic production of strangeness. This work looks back over 70 years of past developments, discusses ongoing work and near-term plans, and details future possibilities being considered for third-generation facilities. Throughout this work, the primary impacts of these explorations are highlighted, along with connections to a wide range of related phenomenological applications.

Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_η$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits."}

As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems."}

However, the polar orthorhombic phase (Pca2_1) responsible for ferroelectricity is metastable and requires extrinsic stabilization, which makes it challenging for integration with silicon. We predict that bilayer 1T-HfO2 can exhibit robust and switchable out-of-plane (OOP) polarization arising from stacking-induced symmetry breaking. Using first-principles density functional theory, we predict that monolayer 1T-HfO2 can be cleaved from the (111) surface of cubic hafnia, and the monolayer is dynamically stable. When two aligned monolayers are twisted to form a moiré superlattice, it breaks the interlayer symmetry and allows the emergence of bistable OOP polarization. At a twist angle of 7.34o, the system exhibits a net polarization of ~16 μC/cm2. This sizeable polarization is due to the large polar displacements concentrated in AB stacking domains. Importantly, this polarization can be reversibly switched via interlayer sliding with a low energy barrier (~8 meV/formula unit) and comparable low coercive field (~0.2 V/nm), offering electric-field tunability. These findings establish twisted bilayer 1T-HfO2 as a scalable and robust 2D ferroelectric platform, enabling new pathways for integrating ferroelectric functionality into atomically thin memory and logic devices."}

After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level.

This mechanism for producing high SD efficiency relies on the expectation that the critical current depends sensitively on the superconducting order. We demonstrate this explicitly by performing detailed calculations for a bilayer superconductor with an in-plane magnetic field, which admits the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) orders as a function of the strength of the magnetic field. We predict a sharp peak in the SD efficiency in the FFLO state close to the transition, which arises from a complex interplay between the two superconducting orders. An implication of our study is that the measurement of the SD efficiency can provide fundamental insight into the nature of the BCS-FFLO transition both as a function of the magnetic field and the supercurrent."}

By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust.

Its recently discovered gate-tunable metamagnetic phase transitions, the remarkable positive and oscillating magnetoresistance as a tunnel barrier, and its Fano-resonance luminescence, elusive among the multitude of Cr3+ compounds, call for revisiting the understanding of its electronic structure, especially regarding how it relates to magnetic order. Here, we employ X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, implemented in both absorption and resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopies, together with quantum many-body calculations, to unveil the complex nature of magnetoelectronic coupling in CrPS4, featuring hybridization between crystal-field and charge-transfer transitions. We reveal the role of extended superexchange paths involving P and S atoms, mediating interactions between the Cr spins across the different magnetic phases: antiferromagnetic, canted, and ferromagnetic. Our results elucidate the electronic states involved in these phases and provide prescriptions for engineering the metamagnetic phase diagram of CrPS4."}

While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy.

It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface."}

Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials."}

Phase-field-crystal simulations of a prototypical face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) transformation resolve strongly anisotropic interface kinetics: the end face advances continuously along the lath long axis, whereas facets thicken by discrete ledge sweeps accompanied by mixed glide-climb reactions in a closed dislocation network. Crystallographic analyses predict the dislocation arrangements, rationalize the anisotropy via the geometry of misfit localization, and show how dislocation motion accommodates the transformation strain. In situ transmission electron microscopy of austenite precipitates in duplex stainless steel captures rapid ledge propagation on habit planes, consistent with the predicted migration mode.

The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an \"exceptional horn\" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\\sim\\vert \\mathbf{q}\\vert^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone.

This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for <c+a> slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications."}

In this study, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the negative SRS using micromechanics-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that couple heterogeneous randomized shear transformation zone (STZ) models for metallic glasses. The model accounted for both the thermomechanical structural rejuvenation and relaxation of the energy barrier for thermal activation of STZs, incorporating a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)-type relaxation function. The present simulations systematically reproduce the dependence of flow stresses on strain rate, temperature, and the form of the relaxation function. The SRS tends to decrease at high strain rates and low temperatures in the simulations, and negative SRS appears when a compressed-exponential relaxation function is employed. Shear localization also appears; however, the conditions under which the observed localization emerges do not fully coincide with those leading to the negative SRS, leaving the dominant factor unclear. To clarify the dominant factor, we introduce a simplified theoretical model that reproduces flow stresses consistent with the simulation results. An analytical expression derived from the theoretical model reveals that negative SRS originates primarily from the temporal evolution of the activation barrier. Specifically, negative SRS arises when the timescale of external loading exceeds that of STZ relaxation."}

Within the framework of quantum estimation theory, we investigate whether flavor measurements, the only observables currently accessible experimentally, are optimal for extracting the oscillation parameters. We compute the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the classical Fisher Information (FI) associated with ideal flavor projections for all oscillation parameters, considering accelerator muon (anti)neutrino and reactor electron antineutrino beams propagating in vacuum. Two main results emerge. First, flavor measurements saturate the QFI at the first oscillation maximum for $θ_{13}$, $θ_{23}$, and $θ_{12}$, demonstrating their information-theoretic optimality for these parameters. In contrast, they are far from optimal for $δ_{CP}$. In particular, only a small fraction of the available information on $δ_{CP}$ is extracted at the first maximum; the sensitivity improves at the second maximum, in line with the strategy of ESS$ν$SB, a planned facility. Second, the QFI associated with $δ_{CP}$ is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the mixing angles, indicating that the neutrino state intrinsically encodes less information about CP violation. Nevertheless, this quantum bound lies well below current experimental uncertainties, implying that the present precision on $δ_{CP}$ is not fundamentally limited. Our results provide a quantitative framework to disentangle fundamental from practical limitations and establish a benchmark for optimizing future neutrino facilities."}

Finite contacts with explicit boundary terminations exhibit substantially higher friction yet remain load independent up to a critical load. Load dependence arises only when elastic out-of-plane deformation near the contact line exceeds a critical amplitude, activating additional dissipation channels. These results demonstrate that contact geometry and local elastic compliance, rather than normal load itself, determine the onset and breakdown of load-independent structural lubricity."}

However, some physical quantities are highly sensitive to small variations in the density. This 'ill-conditioning' limits the accuracy with which these quantities can be learned as density functionals from a fixed amount of data. We identify sources of ill-conditioning present in density functionals that belong to two ubiquitous classes: 1) Physical quantities that are globally gauge-dependent, meaning they change value if a constant shift is applied to the external potential -- for example, the total energy; 2) Functionals of the N-electron density that have an implicit dependence on the (N+1)-electron density, such as the fundamental gap. We demonstrate that widely used ML models exhibit orders-of-magnitude greater error when applied to these ill-conditioned density functionals compared to other functionals that fall into neither class, even when the global gauge is fixed to prevent constant shifts. Owing to an absence of ill-conditioning in potential functionals, we find that providing the external potential as input to the ML model leads to significantly improved predictions of quantities in these two classes."}

This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for <c+a> slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications."}

They are defined either through heuristically identified microscopic transitions, capturing events such as single-ion hops, multi-ion hops, and vehicular motion, or through transitions between chemically interpretable coordination macrostates. The construction guarantees that attributed contributions sum exactly to the Onsager transport coefficients estimated via the Green-Kubo/Einstein formalism, while scanning the sampling window exposes characteristic temporal scales at which distinct transport mechanisms emerge and dominate. Applied across three prototypical electrolytes-inorganic crystals, liquids, and polymers-the framework quantitatively resolves long-standing debates (e.g., the role of concerted motion and exchange), identifies dominant mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, quantifies their frequencies and effectiveness, and extracts activation energies for distinct transport modes, thereby distilling design rules for fast conduction.

While the average grain boundary mobility and the fraction of plastic work converted into stored energy are not precisely known, by fitting simulations to experimental data, we show that the average grain boundary mobility can be determined if the fraction of plastic work converted to stored energy is known, or vice versa. For low annealing temperatures, we observe a discrepancy between the model and experiments in the late stages of recrystallization, where a slowdown in recrystallization kinetics occurs in the experiments. We discuss possible sources of this slowdown and propose additional physical mechanisms that need to be accounted for in the model to improve its predictions."}

In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band."}

During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions."}

Combining polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction on single-crystal $\\mathrm{HoTe}_3$, we identify two distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, both exhibiting a collinear $\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow$ motif within individual vdW layers. The two phases are distinguished by the vdW stacking of magnetic layers: ferromagnetic (FM) stacking in the higher-temperature AFM-II phase, here termed ``vertical-stripe'', and AFM stacking in the AFM-I ground state, here termed ``tilted-stripe''; the two phases have propagation vectors $\\boldsymbol{q}_{\\mathrm{m2}} = (0.48, 0, 0)$ and $\\boldsymbol{q}_{\\mathrm{m1}} = (0.5, 0.5, 0)$, respectively.

The relative alignment between AFM and CDW propagation vectors, as well as single-ion anisotropy, are likely essential for generating coupled spin/charge orders in layered vdW systems."}

However, achieving long-range interfacial order while maintaining high-quality graphene remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-area quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) via the intercalation of a two-dimensional (2D) Sn. While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms."}

We investigate CsPbBr3 microcrystals using photoluminescence, Raman and reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature, revealing the simultaneous presence of high-energy and Rashba excitons, each accompanied by distinct phonon replica series. High-energy exciton replicas are uniquely spaced by approximately 9 meV, whereas Rashba exciton replicas exhibit a characteristic approximately 6 meV spacing, indicating the specificity of the exciton-phonon coupling. Unsupervised machine learning applied to a large low-temperature photoluminescence dataset reveals these replica features are prevalent. With increasing temperature, replica features broaden and merge, evolving into a dominant longitudinal optical phonon coupling regime at room temperature. This work establishes direct spectroscopic evidence for concurrent, exciton-specific phonon coupling within a single material, offering new pathways to engineer light-matter interactions for optoelectronic and phonon-photon-based quantum device applications."}

By combining tensor hypercontraction via interpolative separable density fitting with $\\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $O(N^3)$ and $O(N^2)$ with arbitrary basis, respectively, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework."}
