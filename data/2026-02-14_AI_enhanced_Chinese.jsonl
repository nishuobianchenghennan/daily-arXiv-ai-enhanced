Consequently, future prospects could probe new physics whose contribution to the electron EDM first arises at three-loop order. Additional SU(2)$_L$ multiplets with CP-violating Yukawa interactions, which contribute to the electron EDM at three-loop level, is one such testable new physics scenario. In this scenario, the electron EDM is radiatively induced from two contributions: the CP-odd trilinear $W$-boson coupling, called the electroweak-Weinberg operator, and the CP-odd dipole operator of electron. The former and the latter operators are generated at two-loop and three-loop levels, respectively, after integrating out the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. Within the same models, according to an analysis based on the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we previously found that the contribution to the electron EDM from the electroweak-Weinberg operator can be probed in future experiments. However, the one-loop matching condition between the electron EDM and the electroweak-Weinberg operator does not receive a large logarithmic enhancement because the associated anomalous dimension is zero. The CP-odd dipole operator of the electron would contribute to the electron EDM at the same three-loop order as the contribution through the electroweak-Weinberg operator. In this paper, we directly calculate the electron EDM induced by the CP-violating Yukawa interactions of the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets at full three-loop level. A central result is that the full three-loop calculation is a factor of three larger than that of the electroweak-Weinberg operator alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916 SU(2)_L \u591a\u91cd\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\uff08EDM\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u5faa\u73af\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4f30\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\uff08EDM\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5df2\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u5728\u4e09\u5faa\u73af\u7ea7\u522b\u624d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5f31-\u6e29\u4f2f\u683c\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u8d21\u732e\u7f3a\u5c11\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4e09\u5faa\u73af\u9636\u6b21\u4e0b\u7531CP\u5947\u7535\u5b50\u5076\u6781\u7b97\u7b26\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e09\u5faa\u73af\uff08three-loop\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u7531 SU(2)_L \u591a\u91cd\u6001\u7684CP\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6c64\u5ddd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6240\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e09\u5faa\u73af\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u603b\u8d21\u732e\u6bd4\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u7535\u5f31-\u6e29\u4f2f\u683c\u7b97\u7b26\uff08electroweak-Weinberg operator\uff09\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5927\u4e86\u4e09\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u7535\u5f31-\u6e29\u4f2f\u683c\u7b97\u7b26\u5916\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u7684CP\u5947\u5076\u6781\u7b97\u7b26\u4e5f\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u7535\u5076\u6781\u77e9\u7684\u603b\u6548\u5e94\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u9884\u671f\u7684\u8981\u5927\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u88ab\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}
