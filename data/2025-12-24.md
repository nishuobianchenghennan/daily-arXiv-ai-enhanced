*Eyal Walach,Efrat Shimshoni*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了具有强无序和对称性的二维约瑟夫森阶梯模型，并发现了一个介于超导体和绝缘体之間的中间相，即玻色玻璃相。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低维无序超导体中，尤其是当约瑟夫森能量与充电能量相当时，无序会显著影响超导体-绝缘体相变，并可能催生出新的物相。本文旨在探究这种强无序情况下的相图结构。

Method: 作者构建了一个双腿约瑟夫森阶梯模型，其参数沿梯腿方向存在宽泛的空间随机分布，但模型整体具有完美的腿交换（`ℤ₂`）对称性。在此基础上，作者应用了强无序实空间重整化群技术来分析系统的强无序极限。

Result: 研究识别出了三个由无序主导的相：无序超导体、无序绝缘体以及一个介于两者之间的中间相。进一步分析表明，这个中间相是玻色玻璃（Bose glass），而无序绝缘相可以映射到一个处于自旋玻璃相的XY自旋链模型。

Conclusion: 通过对具有`ℤ₂`对称性的强无序双腿约瑟夫森阶梯模型进行分析，本文揭示了其丰富的相图，确认了在超导相和绝緣相之间存在一个玻色玻璃中间相。

Abstract: Disordered superconductors in low dimensions provide an exemplary manifestation for the role of quantum fluctuations in a many-body system. Specifically in Josephson arrays with comparable Josephson and charging energies ($E_J\sim E_C$), disorder tends to change the nature of the paradigmatic Superconductor-Insulator Transition (SIT) and potentially leads to formation of multiple distinct phases. We address this problem in a model of a two-legged Josephson ladder subjected to a wide spatial distribution of its parameters along the legs. In contrast, we assume the system to have a perfect $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to interchange between the legs, and investigate the effects of spatial randomness which preserves this symmetry in the strong-disorder limit. To this end, we apply a strong randomness real-space renormalization group technique and explore the resulting phase diagram. We identify three disorder-dominated phases, including an intermediate phase between a disordered superconductor and a disordered insulator. The latter insulating phase can be mapped to a XY spin-chain in a spin glass phase, while the intermediate phase turns out to be a Bose glass.

TL;DR: 研究人员通过高通量计算发现了一种名为 YSbH₆ 的新材料，它有望在相对较低的压力（50 GPa）下成为一个临界温度很高（118 K）的超导体，并验证了其合成潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找高温超导体是材料科学的核心挑战。富氢化合物是极有前景的候选材料，但通常需要极高的压力才能稳定。因此，本研究旨在寻找一种在相对温和的压力下就能实现高温超导的富氢材料。

Method: 研究团队采用了一种多阶段高通量计算筛选方法。他们首先对三元A15型氢化物进行筛选，然后利用“临时数据驱动势”（ephemeral data derived potentials）加速对Y-Sb-H体系进行高通量计算搜索，并对最终确定的材料进行了全面的稳定性（热力学、动力学、动力学和弹性）分析。

Result: 研究团队发现了一种名为YSbH₆的新型氢化物。预测表明，该材料在50 GPa的压力下，超导临界温度高达118 K。分析显示，虽然它在热力学上是亚稳态的，但在较宽的压力范围内具有动力学稳定性，并在中等压力下表现出动力学和弹性稳定性，这为其实验合成提供了可能性。

Conclusion: YSbH₆是一个典型的案例，展示了在三元氢化物中，高超导临界温度性能与有限的热力学稳定性之间的权衡。这项研究强调了综合运用动力学、热力学、动力学和弹性稳定性分析对于指导实验合成亚稳态超导体的重要性。

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductors remains a central challenge in materials science. Hydrogen-rich compounds are among the most promising candidates, as they can exhibit phonon-mediated superconductivity at elevated critical temperatures, though their stabilization typically requires extreme pressures. %
Here, we report the identification of YSbH$_{6}$ as a promising superconductor by a multi-stage high-throughput screening on ternary A15-type hydrides, followed by a high-throughput computational search of the Y--Sb--H system, accelerated by ephemeral data derived potentials. %
The cubic $Pm\Bar{3}$ YSbH$_{6}$ phase exhibits a predicted critical temperature of 118\,K at 50\,GPa, among the highest $T_{\rm c}$ reported to date for an A15-hydride at this pressure. Thermodynamic analysis shows that YSbH$_{6}$ lies $\sim$100\,meV/atom above the convex hull at 50\,GPa, but only 26\,meV/atom above the hull at 120\,GPa, suggesting possible metastability and synthesis at similar high pressure conditions. The phase is dynamically stable over a wide pressure range (20--120\,GPa), displays kinetic stability at 50\,GPa and elastic stability at 20 and 50\,GPa, key ingredients for long-lived metastable behaviour at moderate pressures. %
These results highlight YSbH$_{6}$ as a benchmark case illustrating the balance between high-$T_{\rm c}$ performance and limited thermodynamic stability in ternary hydrides, and underscore the importance of combined dynamic, thermodynamic, kinetic and elastic stability analyses for guiding experimental synthesis of metastable superconductors.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic (impurity-independent) spin Nernst effect (SNE), a spin current generation perpendicular to temperature gradients, in spin-triplet superconductors. We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors.

TL;DR: 這篇論文提出了一種名為“量子化四極矩超導體”的新型二階拓撲超導體，其邊界上存在馬約拉納角模式，並由半量子化的四極矩拓撲不變量來表徵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有的二階拓撲超導體研究未能完全涵蓋所有情況。本文旨在提出一種新型的拓撲超導體，它能穩定地承載對量子計算至關重要的馬約拉納零模（Majorana zero modes），並提供具體的實現方案。

Method: 作者引入了一類新的“量子化四極矩超導體”。他們使用超導體固有的物理量——四極矩，作為拓撲不變量來定義這個新物態。接著，他們以雙層二維電子氣中的混合配對（$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm id_{xy}$ 和 $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm is$）為例，驗證了四極矩超導相的存在，並討論了其在擾動下的穩定性。

Result: 研究發現，由於粒子-空穴對稱性，作為拓撲不變量的四極矩總是半量子化的。在具體模型中，成功誘導出了這種新的“四極矩相”。擴展討論表明，這種非平凡的拓撲相對混合配對中的相位波動和無序具有魯棒性（robustness）。

Conclusion: 該研究提出的方案為實現馬約拉納零模提供了現實的平台，為研究馬約拉納物理學鋪平了道路。

Abstract: We introduce a class of superconductors termed "quantized quadrupole superconductors" that support Majorana corner modes according to the bulk-corner correspondence, distinct from previous works on the second-order topological superconductors. An intrinsic physical quantity for superconductors, i.e., the quadrupole moment serves as the topological invariant, which is always half-quantized due to the particle-hole symmetry. As examples, two types of mixed pairings, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm id_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm is$, induced in the bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling give the quadrupole phase. Extended discussions indicate that the nontrivial phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and the disorders. Our schemes provide realistic platforms to implement Majorana zero modes, paving the way for studying the Majorana physics.

Abstract: Near a quantum critical point (QCP) in a metal, strong Fermion-Fermion interactions mediated by soft collective bosons give rise to two competing phenomena: non-Fermi liquid behavior and superconductivity that deviates from conventional BCS and Migdal-Eliashberg theories. We consider the problem of obtaining closed-form analytical lower and upper bounds on transition temperatures for such systems. We focus mainly on a class of models known as the gamma-model, which generalizes the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity where the effective interaction potential scales as V(Omega) ~ 1/|Omega|^gamma. Building on a recent reformulation of Migdal-Eliashberg theory, expressed as a classical infinite spin chain with nonlocal interactions, and employing a simple linear algebra framework, we derive rigorous closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the superconducting transition temperature for any gamma > 0. While our lower bounds coincide precisely with those previously in the literature, our derivation offers a more streamlined and accessible method. Moreover, our upper bounds are substantially tighter than any existing estimates and converge rapidly enough to the numerical results from various prior studies.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of topological superconductivity based on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in an altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that introducing dependency interactions between two superconducting networks can trigger abrupt, hysteretic normal-superconductor phase transitions. In this study, we demonstrate that such behavior can also arise in a single-network superconducting system that features two distinct types of interactions: short-range electrical connectivity and long-range thermal dependency. Using experimental and simulation methods, we show that when sufficient heat is dissipated within a single-layer disordered superconducting network, the system undergoes a mixed-order phase transition marked by both a discontinuous change in resistance and critical scaling behavior. We find that the emergence and characteristics of these abrupt transitions depend critically on the thermal conductivity of the underlying substrate, establishing heat flow as the origin of the unique phase transition. Additionally, both experimental and numerical results reveal long-lived transient states and scaling dynamics near the critical point, consistent with spontaneous branching processes observed in interdependent networks theory. These findings strongly demonstrate that complex critical phenomena, such as mixed-order transitions, previously attributed to structurally interdependent systems, can also arise within single-layer physical systems when dual interactions coexist. Our results broaden the scope of the theory and experiments of phase transitions in interdependent networks and suggest new ways to design and control phase changes in physical, biological, and technological systems where two interactions are present.

Abstract: In strongly correlated superconductors, the emergence of superconductivity is often accompanied by anomalous normal state. The connection between these two phenomena is considered crucial for understanding the underlying unconventional pairing mechanisms. In this study, we report analogous behavior in MoS2, a band insulator devoid of long-range magnetic order. Through ionic liquid gating, continuous doping control from the underdoped to the overdoped regime was achieved, revealing a symmetric superconducting dome that holds characteristic scaling relations mirror the behavior of strongly correlated superconductors. Strikingly, this system exhibits pronounced non-Fermi liquid transport near optimal doping, characterized by a quasi-linear temperature dependence of resistivity over a wide range and a T2-dependent Hall angle cotangent. The strength of the non-Fermi liquid transport is positively correlated with the superconducting transition temperature, with both evolving synchronously across the phase diagram. These results highlight the potential of MoS2 as an ideal platform for studying the intrinsic connection between non-Fermi liquid transport and superconductivity.

Abstract: We present an ensemble machine-learning approach for composition-based, structure-agnostic screening of candidate superconductors among ternary hydrides under high pressure. Hydrogen-rich hydrides are known to exhibit high superconducting transition temperatures, and ternary or multinary hydrides can stabilize superconducting phases at reduced pressures through chemical compression. To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of ensemble-based machine learning as a primary screening tool for identifying promising regions of chemical space in superconducting hydrides.

Abstract: The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder yet yields the highest TC, indicating that in the Ti40V60 alloys, moderate disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the V under-layer and pristine films without under-layer, along with a coherence length (~6.2 nm) much smaller than the film thickness (25 nm), confirms the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.

Abstract: A series of experiments revealed that novel bipartite magnetic and superconducting (SC) phases widely exist in the phase diagrams of iron pnictides and chalcogenides. Nevertheless, the origin of the two-dome magnetic and SC phases in iron-based compounds remains unclear. Here we theoretically investigated the electronic structures, magnetic and SC properties of three representative iron-based systems, i.e. LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_{x}$, LaFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O and KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. We propose a unified quasi-degenerate orbital mechanism for the emergence of the two-dome parent magnetic/structural phase and the subsequent two-dome SC phase. It is found that the degenerate in-plane anisotropic $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals dominate the first magnetic/structural and SC phases, while in-plane isotropic orbitals $d_{xy}$ or $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ with quasi-degeneracy originating from quasi-symmetry drive the emergence of the second magnetic/SC dome phase. Moreover, a matching rule of spin and orbital modes for SC pairing state is proposed in multi-orbital iron-based systems. These results imply an orbital-driven mechanism as well as an orbital-selective scenario, and shed light on the understanding of the multi-dome magnetic and SC phases in multi-orbital systems.

Abstract: Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc<TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.

Abstract: We combine a cryogenic BiCMOS integrated circuit, which generates high-speed return-to-zero (RTZ) pulses, with a superconducting Josephson junction array. The BiCMOS circuit acts as a cryogenic pulse pattern generator, delivering data rates of 30 Gb/s, while consuming 302 mW at 4 K. Each electrical pulse of the serializer effectively transfers one magnetic flux quantum through every Josephson junction, so that the average output voltage of the array produces well-defined plateaus (Shapiro steps) in its current-to-voltage characteristic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of a Josephson junction array with a cryogenic BiCMOS chip. The presented results pave the way toward a hybrid and fully integrated Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer (JAWS) that can generate ultra-low-noise signals for quantum voltage metrology and quantum information systems.

Abstract: In a recent experiment [Nature 642, 58 (2025)], a new record for the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer nickelates has been reported in doped SmNiO$_2$. Here, we use the cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), and qualitatively as well as quantitatively reproduce the $T_c$ vs. doping dome for this compound. Encouraged by this, we go further and identify a path towards realizing even higher $T_c$'s by changing the cation along the line Nd$\rightarrow$Sm$\rightarrow$Y$\rightarrow$Lu with matching substrates. The successively smaller cation radius allows for smaller lattice constants of the substrate. This in turn increases the in-plane hopping and thus eventually $T_c$.

Abstract: Murunskite K$_2$Cu$_3$FeS$_4$ is a representative sulfosalt, isostructural to the pnictides, but with electronic properties more similar to the insulating parent compounds of the cuprates. We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides.
  In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers.
  In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates.

Abstract: We develop theoretical methods to predict the effects of paramagnetic impurities on the microwave response of conventional spin-singlet superconductors. Our focus is on superconducting devices and resonators with low concentrations of impurities and exchange interactions with conduction electrons. We connect the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum generated by pair-breaking to the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity for superconductors operating at microwave frequencies. We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance. We predict anomalies in the resonant frequency, $f(T)$, and quality factor, $Q(T)$, of high-Q SRF cavities operating in the GHz range at low-temperatures that are sensitive to non-magnetic and paramagnetic impurity disorder.

Abstract: We summarize recent progress toward the next generation of CTEQ-TEA parton distribution functions, CT25, based on a global NNLO analysis that incorporates a significant sample of newly included LHC data. We present a baseline fit within the forthcoming full CT25 fit, which includes new Drell-Yan, top-pair, and inclusive-jet data at 8 and 13 TeV, and exhibits non-trivial pulls on the high-$x$ gluon and the flavor structure of the quark sea. In the context of progress toward CT25, we also summarize several recent and ongoing studies of the interplay between phenomenological PDFs and lattice-QCD calculations, simultaneous extractions of $α_s(M_Z)$ within the CT framework, and an expanded program of uncertainty quantification that treats parametrization dependence as an explicit source of epistemic uncertainty, among other issues. We also briefly highlight CT efforts to understand the effects of partial implementations of N$^3$LO corrections into PDF fits, which include benchmark calculations for Higgs and vector-boson processes. We comment on the implications of recent improvements to the CT analysis for precision phenomenology at the LHC and future facilities.

### [19] [$N_{\textrm{eff}}$ Constraint on Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19782)
*Chee Sheng Fong,Yago Porto*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 这篇论文利用宇宙微波背景（CMB）数据，为一种被称为“伪狄拉克”的中微子模型中第三代中微子的质量分裂设置了新的、更严格的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为中微子振荡无法区分狄拉克和马约拉纳两种质量类型。但如果中微子是伪狄拉克粒子（与惰性中微子混合），会产生微小的质量分裂。目前对第三代中微子质量分裂的限制较弱，本文旨在利用宇宙学观测来加强这一限制。

Method: 作者首先将复杂的伪狄拉克情景简化为一个有效的“3+1”模型。然后，他们利用宇宙微波背景（CMB）对中微子有效相对论自由度（$N_{	extrm{eff}}$）的观测限制，来推导对第三代中微子质量分裂（$|\delta m_3^2|$）的约束。

Result: 利用现有CMB数据，论文得出了一个新的限制：$|\delta m_3^2| < 2 	imes 10^{-6}\,{m eV}^2$。此外，研究预测未来的CMB-S4和CMB-HD实验可以将此限制再提高一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，宇宙学观测可以为粒子物理中的基本问题（如中微子质量的本质）提供强有力的约束。通过CMB数据，本工作成功地为伪狄拉克中微子模型的关键参数设定了新的界限，并指出了未来实验的探索潜力。

Abstract: After the electroweak symmetry breaking, we can write down two types of mass for the Standard Model neutrinos, Dirac or Majorana. It is often said that both types of mass cannot be distinguished in neutrino oscillation phenomena. This is in fact not true if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac (strictly speaking still Majorana) where they mix almost maximally with sterile neutrinos to form pseudo-Dirac pairs. If this is indeed realized in Nature, what we observe experimentally as three mass eigenstates are actually three pairs of mass eigenstates with yet-to-be-measured new mass splitting among each pair. While the new mass squared splitting of the first and second mass eigenstates have stringent constraints from solar neutrino to be $|δm_{1,2}^2| \lesssim10^{-11}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$, the one regarding the third mass eigenstate has a weaker constraint $|δm_3^2| \lesssim10^{-5}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$. By keeping only one nonzero pseudo-Dirac mass squared splitting at a time, we derive an effective 3+1 description for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. Then we use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint on neutrino relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\textrm{eff}}$ to derive a new constraint $|δm_3^2| < 2 \times 10^{-6}\,{\rm eV}^2$ and show that the future CMB-S4 and CMB-HD can improve this bound by an order of magnitude.

Abstract: First observation of solar neutrinos through coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering by dark matter (DM) direct detection (DD) experiments makes the study of the neutrino fog of the most relevance. This irreducible neutrino background depends on the target material as well as other experimental parameters. Recently, it has also been remarked the dependence of the neutrino fog on the DM models under consideration. In this work, we study the case of Isospin-violating dark matter (IVDM) models, discussing specific examples of DM models and making a detailed analysis of the implications of IVDM on the neutrino fog. We also explore the conditions under which this background can be mitigated for specific DM models.

Motivation: 日本质子加速器研究中心（J-PARC）的材料与生命科学实验设施（MLF）拥有世界上最高的散裂中子产额，并且其束流功率预计将进一步提升。这为开展相干弹性中微子-核散射（CEνNS）实验提供了前所未有的机遇，可用于探索多种粒子物理学现象。

Abstract: The Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) currently delivers a 1 MW, 3 GeV proton beam to the Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF). Power is expected to increase to 1.3 MW, driven by the needs of Hyper-Kamiokande. As a result, the MLF presently provides the highest neutron yield of any spallation source, while potentially holding the best current and foreseeable conditions for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$ν$NS) experimentation. We explore this potential, using as examples detector technologies presently funded for construction and under development. We quantify their sensitivity to a rich variety of particle physics scenarios, finding that very-high-statistics CE$ν$NS measurements with significant sensitivity to relevant scenarios are feasible at this facility within the next few years.

TL;DR: 本文建立了一个“一一对应原则”，将粒子物理中离散味对称性的破缺与标量场的真空排列修正直接关联，为识别和修正非阿贝尔味模型中一种被忽视的微调问题提供了新机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多成功的非阿贝尔味模型中，存在一种与标量场真空排列相关的微妙微调问题，这种微调在唯象学上很重要，但却常常被模型构建者忽略。本文的动机就是为了揭示并提供一种系统性的方法来识别和修正这种隐藏的微调。

Method: 研究首先在一个简化的、具有非阿贝尔对称性的单标量势模型中，证明了特定的真空排列会保留一个离散的剩余味对称性。接着，作者反向证明，当在拉格朗日量中加入破坏该剩余对称性的算符（例如，多味子算符或高维有效算符）时，真空排列会发生扰动和“重新定向”。基于此，作者构建了剩余对称性破缺与真空排列修正之间的“一一对应原则”，并先在基于S4对称性的玩具模型中验证，最后将其应用于更真实的A4和Δ(27)模型。

Result: 研究成功地构建了“一一对应原则”，即破缺的剩余对称性与真空排列的修正之间存在一一对应的关系。研究表明，当引入破坏剩余对称性的算符时，真空会发生重新定向，并带来可观测的唯象学后果。该原则在S4玩具模型以及更真实的A4和Δ(27)模型中都得到了验证。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个机制，通过将剩余对称性的破缺与真空排列的修正联系起来，可以识别并修正非阿贝尔味模型中一种长期被忽视的微调问题。这一“一一对应原则”有助于构建更自然、更少微调的粒子物理模型。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, upon minimizing a renormalizable, single-scalar potential invariant under a non-Abelian symmetry, special orientations in the associated vacuum alignment of the scalar multiplet correspond to the preservation of a discrete residual flavour symmetry in the broken phase of the theory. Conversely, we show that these special scalar alignments are perturbed when additional Lagrangian operators (e.g. renormalizable, multi-flavon operators and/or effective, higher-dimensional operators) are present that break said residual symmetry, leading to a vacuum reorientation and phenomenological consequences. We therefore construct a one-to-one correspondence principle between broken residual symmetries and vacuum alignment corrections, providing a mechanism to identify (and correct) a subtle but persistent form of phenomenologically relevant fine-tuning embedded in -- but often ignored by -- most successful non-Abelian flavour models. We first establish this correspondence in a set of toy models based on the S4 permutation symmetry, and then apply the lessons learned to the more realistic A4 Altarelli-Feruglio and $Δ(27)$ Universal Texture Zero models.

*Gudrun Hiller,Dominik Suelmann*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 这篇论文指出，可以通过寻找粲强子（如D介子和Λc重子）的稀有衰变来探测标准模型之外的不可见粒子（如轴子、暗光子等）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标准模型中，粲强子衰变为某些不可见粒子（如中微子对）的分支比应该为零，这提供了一个清晰的检验标准。然而，目前对这类过程的实验限制很弱，这为寻找超出标准模型的新物理粒子（如轴子类粒子、暗光子）提供了机会。

Method: 作者重新利用和解释了现有对粲强子稀有衰变（$D 	o (π, ω) X$, $D^ 0 	o X$, $Λ_c 	o p X$）的实验搜索结果。他们在多种新物理理论框架下（包括轻的新物理模型、标准模型有效场论SMEFT）计算了这些衰变过程的分支比，其中X代表不可见的粒子。

Result: 研究发现，对于不同的新物理模型，这些稀有衰变的分支比上限可以达到 $10^{-3}$ (暗光子) 到 $10^{-4}$ (轴子类粒子)。对于标准模型有效场论（SMEFT）中的重物理，手性保持过程的限制更强（分支比上限为几 $	imes 10^{-5}$），而手性翻转过程的限制较弱（分支比上限为几 $	imes 10^{-4}$）。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，利用粲强子的稀有衰变是寻找新物理的有效方法，这些过程可以在当前和未来的高亮度实验中进行研究，如BESIII、Belle II、超级tau-粲工厂（STCF）以及FCC-ee和CEPC。

Abstract: We point out opportunities to probe invisible particles, left- and right-handed neutrinos, axion-like particles (ALPs) and dark photons $(Z^\prime)$ with rare decays of charm hadrons. We employ and recast existing searches in $D \to (π, ω) X$, $D^ 0 \to X$ and $Λ_c \to p X$, where $X$ denotes one of the above invisible final states including dineutrinos. The branching ratios are clean null tests of the standard model, yet, are essentially unconstrained for some parameters of light new physics, limited only by weak lifetime constraints at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. On the other hand, if models are probed, branching ratios still reach up to $10^{-3}$ ($Z^\prime$) and $10^{-4}$ (ALPs). Chirality-preserving operators from heavy new physics in the dimension six standard model effective theory (SMEFT) imply tighter upper limits, up to few $\times 10^{-5}$. Constraints on chirality-flipping heavy new physics, such as lepton number violation from dimension seven SMEFT, or with light sterile neutrinos, are weaker, with branching ratios up to few$\times 10^{-4}$. Sensitivities to different couplings arise with $Λ_c \to p X$ and $D \to ππX$ decays, in particular in relation with the other modes. Processes can be studied at running and future experiments with high charm luminosities, BESIII, Belle II, a super-tau-charm factory (STCF) and $Z$-factories, such as FCC-ee and CEPC.

TL;DR: 该研究将一种重要的几何计算方法（锥形包和三角剖分）进行了扩展，使其能够求解一类更复杂的物理积分（包含多伽马函数的梅林-巴恩斯积分），并发布了相应的计算软件包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物理学和数学中，尤其是在多圈、多尺度费曼积分的计算中，梅林-巴恩斯（Mellin-Barnes, MB）积分是一种标准工具。现有的基于锥形包和三角剖分的几何方法只能处理积分函数仅包含伽马函数比率的MB积分。然而，在费曼积分的计算过程中，尤其是在处理维度参数ε的奇点时，自然会出现包含多伽马函数（polygamma functions）的MB积分，这限制了现有方法的应用范围。

Method: 研究人员将现有的锥形包和三角剖分技术进行扩展。他们提出，在应用这些技术识别贡献级数解的极点时，可以像处理伽马函数一样处理多伽马函数的宗量。然而，考虑到多伽马函数与伽马函数奇点结构的不同，论文根据积分轮廓是直线还是非直线，提出了两种不同的计算方法。这些算法已被集成到更新版的Mathematica软件包`MBConicHulls.wl`中。

Result: 作者成功地将锥形包和三角剖分方法扩展到包含多伽马函数的MB积分。他们开发了相应的算法，并将其在一个名为 `MBConicHulls.wl` 的 Mathematica 软件包的新版本中实现。此外，他们通过一系列来自费曼积分计算的实例，展示了这些新算法的实际用途。

Conclusion: 该论文成功地将锥形包和三角剖分等几何方法扩展，使其能够计算包含多伽马函数（polygamma functions）的梅林-巴恩斯（Mellin-Barnes）积分。这解决了现有方法仅限于处理伽马函数的局限性，并为费曼积分计算提供了一个更强大的工具。

Abstract: Mellin-Barnes (MB) integrals appear in various branches of physics and mathematics and are, in particular, used as a standard tool for evaluating multi-loop, multi-scale Feynman integrals both analytically and numerically. Recent geometric approaches based on conic hulls and triangulations provide a systematic framework for computing multiple MB integrals in terms of multivariate series. These approaches have so far been limited to MB integrals whose integrands are ratios of products of Euler's gamma functions only. However, in Feynman integral calculus, MB integrals with polygamma functions naturally arise, for instance, after resolving singularities in the dimensional-regularisation parameter $ε$ and expanding the MB integrand in powers of $ε$, as done by the public codes MB.m and MBresolve.m. In this paper, we extend the conic hull and triangulation methods to the computation of MB integrals having polygamma functions in their integrand. We show that the arguments of polygamma functions can be treated in a similar way to the arguments of gamma functions when applying the conic hull and triangulation techniques to identify poles that would contribute to different series solutions. However, since the singularity structure of the polygamma function is different from that of the gamma function, we propose two different ways to compute MB integrals involving polygamma functions, depending on whether the MB integral has straight or non-straight contours. We have implemented these algorithms in an updated version of the Mathematica package MBConicHulls.wl, which can be found at https://github.com/SumitBanikGit/MBConicHulls/, and we illustrate their use with a set of examples from Feynman integral calculus.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种左右对称模型中的轻子生成新机制，该机制利用规范单线态中介子的衰变来产生宇宙的重子不对称性，并预测了可观测的暗辐射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的左右对称模型在解释轻子生成时，会面临来自规范相互作用的热化或冲刷效应的限制，并且可能出现重子不对称性相互抵消的问题。该研究旨在探索一种新途径来规避这些问题。

Method: 作者采用了一种“普适跷跷板机制”（Universal Seesaw）下的左右对称模型。与传统方法不同，他们利用了规范单线态中介子（gauge-singlet mediators）的衰变来产生CP破坏，从而生成重子不对称性。

Result: 该方案成功避免了传统模型中的热化/冲刷效应限制，并表明低尺度的左右对称性破缺是可行的。此外，模型预测最轻的右旋中微子可以作为一种丰度与标准宇宙学相符、且潜在可观测的“暗辐射”。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方案为在左右对称模型中实现轻子生成提供了一条可行且独特的路径，解决了传统模型的若干限制，并提出了一个可通过暗辐射进行检验的预言。

Abstract: We study the implications for leptogenesis in a class of left-right symmetric model, where all fermion masses are induced through the Universal Seesaw mechanism. Unlike conventional analyses, we do not use the decays of the neutrino embedded in the right-chiral lepton doublet, but rather those of the gauge-singlet mediators required for neutrino mass generation in the canonical Type-I seesaw. Due to the generalized parity symmetry that doubles the fermionic degrees of freedom in this model, we can generate the required $CP$ violation in the heavy fermion decays with only a single generation of mediators. One of the distinct features of our scenario is that the bounds from thermalization or washout via gauge interactions typically encountered in the canonical left-right symmetric models do not apply here. Moreover, the heavy mediators can decay to both the left and the right-chiral neutrinos, leading to a cancellation in the resulting baryon asymmetry for decays above the left-right symmetry breaking scale. We discuss ways to avoid this cancellation and show that low scale left-right symmetry breaking above the current collider limits is viable. The right chiral neutrinos also obtain their masses from the seesaw mechanism, and the lightest one turns out to have a sub-eV scale mass. We find that its abundance is consistent with standard cosmology, and it acts as potentially observable dark radiation.

Abstract: The gluon emission from an energetic heavy quark is suppressed in the forward direction below the angle $Θ\lesssim m_Q/E$ for a quark of mass $m_Q$ and energy $E$ according to perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) (``dead cone"). Another consequence is the suppression of energetic particles in the jet which has been observed already for c- and b-quark jets. The suppression of the forward particles can be explained by an application of the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) of perturbative QCD. In this paper we investigate whether this type of analysis can be carried out also for top-quark jets with the much higher heavy quark mass allowing for QCD tests in this new kinematic regime. The new aspect of this analysis is the finite lifetime of the top quark. We consider for simplicity the decay $t\to b\ellν$, where the b-quark radiates gluons as well and partially obscures the dead cone. Guided by the decay amplitude in leading order in $α_s$ we propose a method to separate the radiation by the $\widehat{tb}$ dipole in the decay process which is superimposed to the primary radiation from the $\widehat{t \bar t}$ dipole involving the top-quark dead cone effect. The momentum distributions of partons or charged particles are determined for finite decay angles of the b-quark $Θ_b$ and extrapolated into forward direction $Θ_b=0$ where the radiation from the decay process is expected to vanish. This method is successfully tested at the parton level and results obtained for hadrons are compatible with the MLLA relation within an accuracy of around 15\%. Our calculations are carried out with the Pythia 8.3 Monte Carlo Event Generator.

Abstract: The dynamical chromoelectric color conductivity of a chiral plasma has been extracted from one loop gluon self energy by using linear response theory at finite temperature and density. It is shown that due to the P and CP violation the conductivity tensor has an anomalous contribution in addition to the longitudinal and transverse components. We identify this anomalous conductivity as chiral chromomagnetic conductivity. The spectral representations of real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and transverse conductivities show marginal variations in chiral plasma as compared to the non-chiral plasma. The static limit of chiral chromomagnetic conductivity is found to be independent of medium properties reflecting its topological nature.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The gravitational wave spectrum arising from using the full velocity profile is well known to differ qualitatively from analytic fits to a broken power law. Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $ακ$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak. All this implies that the spectrum is sensitive to five thermal parameters rather than four which gives hope that an observation of a gravitational wave spectrum from a first order cosmological phase transition could eventually give even more information about the underlying microphysics responsible.

Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of near-threshold states is essential for revealing the nature of exotic hadrons. Motivated by this challenge, we discuss the clustering structures of near-threshold $s$-wave eigenstates using the compositeness, which characterizes the clustering nature of the states. We show that shallow bound states usually possess cluster-dominant structures, while near-threshold narrow resonances are non-cluster-dominant. Through this study, we establish a theoretical foundation for the threshold energy rule, which has been known empirically.

Abstract: In this Ph.D. thesis, we study the methods to constrain particle physics models using the stochastic GW imprints from cosmological phase transitions (PTs). Beginning with the theory and background, we describe how the GW background from first-order PTs (FOPTs) and topological defects such as domain walls (DWs) can constrain the model parameter space at upcoming GW observatories. The first BSM scenario involves a flavon FOPT in two ultraviolet-complete models of the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism. In both models, for the FN symmetry-breaking scale $v_s = 10^{4-7}\,$GeV, the parameter space is constrained by GWs in upcoming observatories such as BBO, DECIGO, CE, and ET. However, the GW spectrum does not discriminate between the two models. Next, we consider FOPT in the doublet left-right symmetric model (DLRSM) during $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking. For the breaking scale $v_R=20,\,30,\,50\,$TeV, the parameter space can be constrained by GW observations at BBO, FP-DECIGO, and Ultimate DECIGO. A large number of points with detectable GW signals can be ruled out from the precise measurement of the trilinear Higgs coupling at future colliders. Finally, we discuss the GW spectrum generated by DWs formed after the spontaneous breaking of the discrete $\mathcal{P}$-symmetry imposed on DLRSM. Using Bayesian analysis, we fit the 15-year NANOGrav dataset to the GW spectrum from DWs in DLRSM and determine the best-fit values of the DW surface tension and the bias potential. The techniques of this thesis can be applied to other BSM scenarios in the future.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the cosmology of an axion that is fundamentally non-compact. During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically.

The experiment is projected to detect $\gtrsim 30$ meV energy deposition with nearly $100\%$ efficiency and high energy resolution. The sensitivity to $m_χ\gtrsim 0.01$ MeV dark matter scattering cross section is expected to be advanced by orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and similar improvements will be achieved for axion and dark photon absorption in the $0.04$-$0.2$ eV mass range.

Abstract: In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe existed in an extremely hot, dense state in which particle interactions occurred not in a vacuum but within a thermal medium. Under such conditions, the standard framework of quantum field theory (QFT) requires a finite temperature extension, wherein propagators -- and hence the fundamental structure of the theory -- are modified to reflect thermal background effects. These thermal modifications are central to understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as a high temperature phase transition, potentially leading to qualitatively different vacuum structures for the Higgs field as the universe cooled. Finite temperature corrections naturally regulate ultraviolet divergences in propagators, hinting at a possible route toward ultraviolet completion. However, these same thermal effects exacerbate infrared pathologies and can lead to imaginary contributions to the effective potential, particularly when analysing metastable or multi-vacuum configurations. Additional theoretical challenges, such as gauge dependence and renormalization scale ambiguity, further obscure the precise characterization of the electroweak phase transition even in minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM). This review presents the theoretical foundations of finite temperature QFT with an emphasis on how different field species respond to thermal effects, identifying the bosonic sector as the primary source of key theoretical subtleties. We focus particularly on the scalar extension of the SM, which offers a compelling framework for realizing first order electroweak phase transitions, electroweak baryogenesis, and accommodating dark matter candidates depending on the underlying $Z_2$ symmetry structure.

Abstract: We propose a holographic model for quarkonia using the WKB approximation with the Langer correction to properly reproduce nonlinear Regge trajectories of the form $m_n^2 = β(n + c_0)^{2/3} + c_1$. This form is expected from previous studies involving the solution of Cornell Potential for heavy quark anti-quark interactions using a model based on the quadratic form of the spinless Salpeter-type equation (QSSE). The model fits experimental masses with very good accuracy. As a by product, the corresponding decay constants also show a reasonable agreement with the results obtained from experimental data.

Abstract: We propose the first scotogenic neutrino mass model with gauged lepton number $U(1)_L$, which is spontaneously broken by three units $ΔL=3$ down to a residual discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_6$. The latter guarantees that neutrinos acquire tiny Dirac masses via a one-loop scotogenic mechanism, simultaneously stabilizing the lightest electrically neutral particle with non-trivial charge under the preserved $\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry. In our model there is a scalar particle identified as weakly interacting massive particle dark matter (DM) candidate. We analyzed its compatibility with the existing data on direct DM detection experiments and the DM relic abundance. We also address charged lepton flavor violating decays in our model and find that their predicted rates are within the reach of current experimental sensitivity.

Abstract: We determine for the first time the two-loop renormalization-group (RG) equation for the nucleon light-cone distribution amplitude, which constitutes the last missing ingredient for the complete next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to the nucleon form factors in the hard-collinear factorization framework. Applying the conformal expansion for this fundamental nucleon distribution amplitude then enables us to construct an analytic solution that captures the desired scale dependence of phenomenologically interesting series coefficients. Importantly, the two-loop RG evolutions of these central hadronic quantities can bring about noticeable impacts on the corresponding leading-logarithmic results for three sample models of the nucleon distribution amplitude.

Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics and the $Λ$CDM model of cosmology provide an incomplete description of our Universe. Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter.

Abstract: QCD at large densities exhibits a moat regime in the scalar-pseudoscalar sector. The resolution of its dynamics is pivotal for the access to the onset of new phases including the potential critical endpoint of QCD. In this work we present the first selfconsistent analysis of this regime with the functional renormalisation group approach to QCD. We map out the moat regime, including a first analysis of potential inhomogeneous instabilities at baryon chemical potential $μ_B\gtrsim 600$ MeV on the chiral crossover line.

Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles introduced initially as a solution to the Strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and they also arise naturally in a broad class of low-energy compactifications of string theory. Astrophysical, cosmological, and laboratory constraints require axions to be extremely weakly coupled to Standard Model particles, making them viable dark matter candidates .This PhD thesis presents original results developed over three years of research, focusing on axion cosmology and axion electrodynamics. These topics address the production of axions and their associated topological defects in the early Universe, as well as the interactions of axions with Standard Model particles. The analysis combines methods from non-equilibrium quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. After reviewing the foundations of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and cosmology, the thesis introduces the Strong CP problem and the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, including the PQWW axion model and its invisible extensions. Ultraviolet completions of QCD axion theories are discussed in both field-theoretic and extra-dimensional frameworks. A significant part of the thesis is devoted to axion electrodynamics, where a classical axion background modifies Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic observables. The non-equilibrium dynamics of self-interacting axion fields coupled to the Standard Model or to a dark sector are also studied using the two-particle-irreducible effective action, and applied to pre- and post-inflationary cosmological scenarios, yielding new insights and preliminary constraints.

Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization, we investigate the relativistic corrections to the production of double $B_c$ mesons in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. The study covers center-of-mass energies from the production threshold up to $2m_Z$, considering both the photon and $Z^0$-boson propagated processes. We find that the relativistic corrections are significant, with the corresponding $K$ factors of approximately 0.6. The azimuthal asymmetry, angular distribution, and transverse momentum distribution are also presented.

Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) factorization, we compute the $\mathcal{O}(v^{4})$ relativistic corrections to the fragmentation of a heavy quark into the color-singlet $^{1}S_{0}^{[1]}$ and $^{3}S_{1}^{[1]}$ quarkonium states. Using the Collins--Soper definition of the fragmentation function, we reproduce the known $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ results. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(v^{4})$ correction gives a positive contribution relative to the leading order result over a wide range of the light-cone momentum fraction $z$, while its magnitude remains much smaller than that of the $\mathcal{O}(v^{2})$ correction. This behavior indicates a good convergence of the NRQCD relativistic expansion in this process. We further extend the calculation to the fragmentation functions in the unequal-mass case at $\mathcal{O}(v^{4})$ and obtain the corresponding analytical expressions.

Abstract: For over thirty years, a $\sim20\%$ deficit, now exceeding $5σ$, has persisted between measured and predicted neutrino capture rates on $^{71}$Ga, as observed in radioactive source experiments (namely GALLEX, SAGE, and more recently BEST) using $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar. This long-standing discrepancy, referred to as the gallium anomaly, has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of both experimental methods and theoretical predictions. In this work, we revisit the theoretical calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section by moving beyond the standard treatment of the leptonic wave functions, revealing limitations in the commonly used factorization approach based on the detailed balance principle. Incorporating phenomenologically constrained Gamow-Teller transition densities, able to correctly reproduce the precisely measured half-life of $^{71}{\textrm{Ge}}$, we find that the revised cross-section can be significantly reduced, potentially resolving the gallium anomaly without invoking new physics.

Abstract: Similar to axions, gravitational waves (GW) can induce oscillating electromagnetic fields inside electromagnetic cavities. We explore their experimental sensitivity to monochromatic and non-monochromatic GW signals, using the total deposited energy as a primary measure. Focusing on cylindrical and spherical cavities, we present the coupling coefficients of GWs to the dominant electromagnetic resonances in transverse-traceless gauge, which is most appropriate in this regime. By considering the superposition of degenerate modes, we further examine their angular sensitivity. In addition, we calculate the response of a spherical cavity to non-monochromatic GWs emitted by primordial black hole mergers. We find that, for transient signals, a high quality factor with $Q \gtrsim 10^5$ does not necessarily enhance experimental sensitivity. In fact, even in the most optimistic scenario, only mergers within the solar system yield an observable energy deposit in the cavity.

Abstract: This research introduces a novel quantitative methodology tailored for quantitative finance applications, enabling banks, stockbrokers, and investors to predict economic regimes and market signals in emerging markets, specifically Sri Lankan stock indices (S&P SL20 and ASPI) by integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) sentiment analysis with macroeconomic indicators and advanced time-series forecasting. Designed to leverage quantitative techniques for enhanced risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies in volatile environments, the architecture employs FinBERT, a transformer-based NLP model, to extract sentiment from ESG texts, followed by unsupervised clustering (UMAP/HDBSCAN) to identify 5 latent ESG regimes, validated via PCA. These regimes are mapped to economic conditions using a dense neural network and gradient boosting classifier, achieving 84.04% training and 82.0% validation accuracy. Concurrently, time-series models (SRNN, MLP, LSTM, GRU) forecast daily closing prices, with GRU attaining an R-squared of 0.801 and LSTM delivering 52.78% directional accuracy on intraday data. A strong correlation between S&P SL20 and S&P 500, observed through moving average and volatility trend plots, further bolsters forecasting precision. A rule-based fusion logic merges ESG and time-series outputs for final market signals. By addressing literature gaps that overlook emerging markets and holistic integration, this quant-driven framework combines global correlations and local sentiment analysis to offer scalable, accurate tools for quantitative finance professionals navigating complex markets like Sri Lanka.

Motivation: 由于金砖国家经济影响力日益增长，需要能捕捉复杂、长期动态的风险模型。传统模型可能无法检测到二阶风险，如恐慌蔓延和地缘政治冲击。

Method: 该研究引入了BRIDGES框架。首先，使用动态时间规整（DTW）基于551家金砖国家银行的资产负债表数据构建动态网络。接着，利用时间图神经网络（TGNN）学习网络演变并检测异常。最后，通过基于代理的模型（ABM）模拟，评估银行系统在内部金融失败和外部地缘政治冲击下的韧性。

Result: 模拟结果显示，最大机构的倒闭比财务脆弱或动态异常的银行倒闭造成的系统性损害更大。而具有相关性的地缘政治冲击破坏性最强，几乎导致系统性崩溃。

Conclusion: 金砖国家金融稳定的主要威胁是二阶恐慌和大规模地缘政治冲击，这些是传统风险分析模型可能忽略的风险。BRIDGES框架能有效识别这些复杂风险。

Abstract: The growing economic influence of the BRICS nations requires risk models that capture complex, long-term dynamics. This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this "too big to fail" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect.

Abstract: The complexity and richness of phenomena governing alloy crystal growth can be unraveled by examining the three-dimensional atomic-level distribution of elements and impurities incorporated during growth. These species act as atomic fingerprints, revealing the thermodynamic constraints that shape material structure and composition. Herein, we combine transmission electron microscopy and atom probe of tellurium (Te) inclusions within cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) single crystals. The correlative analysis uncovers nanoscale precipitates embedded within Te inclusions, consisting of CZT nanocrystals with a Zn content of 1.5 at.%. Surrounding these precipitates, an around 10 nm-thick shell is observed, enriched with copper and indium impurities. In addition, traces of sodium and sulfur are detected within the nanocrystals. These findings provide direct evidence of the complex segregation and precipitation processes occurring during CZT crystal growth, reflecting the interplay of thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic constraints that govern solute redistribution. The resulting insights contribute to a deeper understanding of impurity behavior and phase separation mechanisms in CZT alloys. This work establishes a framework for modeling and optimization of growth strategies of higher-quality CZT crystals for next-generation infrared and radiation detection technologies.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic EuM$_{2}$Pn$_{2}$ compounds, where M is a metal element and Pn is a pnictogen element, have been recognized as candidates for realizing a topologically nontrivial electronic structure. In this paper, we focus on EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$, whose topological nature still remains unclear. We present a comprehensive study based on several experimental and theoretical techniques. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific heat capacity measurements confirm the existence of an antiferromagnetic ordering. The electronic band structure was investigated by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), supported by ab initio calculations. ARPES measurement reveals that the electronic structure of this system is dominated by linearly dispersive hole-like bands near the Fermi level. Theoretical analyses of the electronic band structure indicates that EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$ is a strong topological insulator, which should be reflected in the presence of a metallic surface state. We also theoretically examine the magnetic-field-induced anomalous Hall conductivity, confirming previously reported observations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合进化算法、原子基础模型和SSCHA的迭代学习框架，以解决在预测具有非谐晶格动力学材料的晶体结构时，现有方法存在的计算成本高和数据依赖性强的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的晶体结构预测（CSP）方法难以处理接近相变的不稳定固体，因为它们无法很好地模拟非谐晶格动力学。虽然有些方法（如SSCHA）可以精确计算非谐效应，但计算成本太高。而机器学习方法虽然快，却需要大量训练数据且泛化能力有限。

Method: 本文提出了一种创新的迭代学习框架，该框架整合了三种技术：1）用于结构搜索的进化算法；2）用于加速结构弛豫并减少训练数据的原子基础模型；3）用于精确计算非谐晶格动力学的随机自洽谐波近似（SSCHA）。

Result: 该框架成功应用于高非谐性的H₃S体系。在50至200 GPa的压力范围内，该方法准确预测了相稳定性和振动特性，与基于密度泛函理论的基准结果高度一致。一个关键发现是，SSCHA中的统计平均可以有效降低机器学习势函数的误差，从而降低了对模型精度的极端要求。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了机器学习的数据效率和第一性原理计算的预测能力，为包含非谐晶格动力学的晶体结构预测提供了一条实用可行的途径。

Abstract: First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics.

Abstract: The layered van der Waals Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT) compound exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, making it a promising candidate for technological applications. In our study, combined temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman measurements, along with modern {\it ab initio} calculations, reveal important aspects of the lattice dynamics. The angle dependence of Raman intensity under linear polarization configuration exhibits a strong tilt in the laboratory coordinate, indicating the existence of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling. The electron-phonon coupling was also examined via the Fano parameter of the asymmetric peak in the Raman spectra. Finally, the threefold rotational symmetry guarantees the existence of chiral phonons. We present direct spectroscopic evidence for these chiral vibrational modes through cross-circularly polarized Raman measurements, complemented by theoretical calculations of phonon circular polarization. Together, these results identify F5GT as an ideal platform for investigating emergent couplings among lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom and for advancing the understanding of chiral phonons in magnetic van der Waals materials.

Abstract: The hole-doped NdNiO$_2$ layer deposited on the SrTiO$_{3}$ surface exhibits unconventional superconductivity. Here, we present a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic properties of the NdNiO$_2$ superconductor using the density functional theory (DFT). The strong local Coulomb interactions in the Ni($3d)$ and Nd($4f$) states are included within the DFT+$U$ method. The effect of Sr doping on the electronic band structure and density of states was studied for the NdNiO$_2$ thin films deposited on the SrTiO$_3$ (001) surface. The results obtained for the uncapped thin films were compared with the calculations for the NdNiO$_2$ films capped by the SrTiO$_3$ layer. We have found significant changes in the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the thin films compared to the bulk crystal.

Abstract: This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2 um in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 μm is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.

Abstract: Excellent gate electrostatics in field effect transistors (FETs) based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) channels can dramatically decrease static power dissipation. Energy efficient FETs operate in enhancement mode with small and positive threshold voltage (Vth) for n-type devices. However, most state-of-the-art FETs based on monolayer MoS2 channel operate in depletion mode with negative Vth due to doping from the underlying dielectric substrate. In this work, we identify key properties of the semiconductor/dielectric interface (MoS2 on industrially relevant high dielectric constant (k) HfO2, ZrO2 and hBN for reference) responsible for realizing enhancement-mode operation of 2D MoS2 channel FETs. We find that hBN and ZrO2 dielectric substrates provide low defect interfaces with MoS2 that enables effective modulation of the Vth using gate metals of different work functions (WFs). We use photoluminescence (PL) and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate doping levels in monolayer MoS2 on different dielectrics with different WF gate metals. We complement the FET and spectroscopic measurements with capacitance-voltage analysis on dielectrics with varying thicknesses, which confirm that Vth modulation in ZrO2 devices is correlated with WF of the gate metals - in contrast with HfO2 devices that exhibit signatures of Vth pinning induced by oxide/interface defect states. Finally, we demonstrate FETs using a 2D MoS2 channel and a 6 nm of ZrO2 dielectric, achieving a subthreshold swing of 87 mV dec-1 and a threshold voltage of 0.1 V. Our results offer insights into the role of dielectric/semiconductor interface in 2D MoS2 based FETs for realizing enhancement mode FETs and highlight the potential of ZrO2 as a scalable high-k dielectric.

Abstract: The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of Néel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.

Abstract: Electromagnetic response is commonly computed in two languages: length-gauge molecular polarizabilities and velocity-gauge (Kubo) conductivities for periodic solids. We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via $(α_{\rm fs})$. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end.
  The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical $(f)$-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and \emph{operando} interfacial diagnostics for integration into multiphysics digital twins.

Abstract: One focal challenge in engineering low-power and scalable all-oxide spintronic devices lies in exploring ferromagnetic oxide material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and electronic conductivity while exhibiting tunable spin states. Targeting this need, spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4, NCO), featured by room-temperature ferrimagnetically metallic ground state with strong PMA, emerges as a promising candidate in the field of oxide spintronics. The cation distribution disorder inherent to NCO renders competing electromagnetic states and abnormal sign reversal of anomalous Hall effect (AHE), introducing an additional freedom to adjust electromagnetic transports. Here, we unveil multi-state electromagnetic phase modulations in NCO system through controllable cation disorder and proton evolution, extensively expanding electromagnetic phase diagram. The cation disorder in NCO tunable by growth temperature is identified as a critical control parameter for kinetically adjusting the proton evolution, giving rise to intermediate hydrogenated states with chemical stability. Hydrogen incorporation reversibly drives structural transformation and electromagnetic state evolutions in NCO, with rich spin-dependent correlated physics uncovered by combining the AHE scaling relation and synchrotron-based spectroscopy. Our work not only establishes NCO as a versatile platform for discovering spin-dependent physical functionality but also extends the horizons in materials design for state-of-the-art spintronic devices harnessing magneto-ionic control and inherent cation disorder.

Abstract: A systematic study of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of cage-like boron clusters, with the number of constituent atoms ranging from 20 to 122, has been carried out within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), employing 6-31G(d, p) extended basis set. The dynamic stability of the clusters is analyzed through the vibrational frequency analysis, while to study the thermodynamic stability, we computed their binding energies per atom. The results suggest that the 32- and 92-atom cages are the most stable among the small and the large structures. The optical absorption spectra of these cages is computed using the time-dependent densityfunctional theory (TDDFT), which suggests their applications in optoelectronic devices in the visible range of the spectrum.

Abstract: Shear band propagation and interaction are critical to the mechanical performance of metallic glasses and are strongly governed by thermal history, yet their microscopic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations combined with a state-of-the-art annealing protocol, we systematically investigate these behaviors in a model metallic glass across effective quenching rates spanning six orders of magnitude. Through a double-notch model, we show that the normalized interaction distance relative to the single shear band width is significantly larger in slowly quenched samples than in rapidly quenched ones. Atomic-scale analysis reveals that rapidly quenched samples exhibit a high density of pre-existing soft regions, which trigger correlated shear transformation zones through local vortex fields, resulting in propagation path locking and weak inter-band coupling. In contrast, slowly quenched samples exhibit enhanced structural heterogeneity and a right-shifted activation energy spectrum, promoting a single large-scale vortex field ahead of the shear band front. This field facilitates long-range stress transmission and induces shear band deflection, convergence, and coalescence, a transition resembling a "shielding effect" in fracture mechanics, where vortex-mediated disturbances destabilize the advancing shear band front. Our findings establish a direct microscopic connection between glass stability and shear-band-mediated plasticity and suggest that regulating shear band interactions offers a promising route to enhance the room-temperature ductility of metallic glasses.

Abstract: Enhancing the kinetic stability of glasses often necessitates deepening thermodynamic stability, which typically compromises ductility due to increased structural rigidity. Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs. This work establishes a paradigm of kinetic stabilization without thermodynamic compromise, offering a roadmap to additively manufacture bulk amorphous materials with combined hyperstability and plasticity.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.

Abstract: The discovery of ordered magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials at the monolayer limit challenges the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in two dimensions at finite temperatures. The persistence of static magnetism in low-dimensions is fundamentally influenced by magnetic anisotropy and the local single-ion crystalline electric field. Crucially, spin-orbit coupling connects the structural properties with spin degrees of freedom. We investigate the magnetic single-ion properties in the van der Waals magnet VI$_3$. Utilizing neutron and x-ray diffraction, we map out the symmetry breaking phase transitions and argue for a single structural transition at T$_S \sim$ 80 K, driven by an orbital degeneracy, followed by a ferromagnetic transition at a lower temperature, T$_C \sim$ 50 K. Through a comparative analysis of samples prepared under varying conditions, we suggest that lower temperature transitions reported near $\sim$ 30 K are not intrinsic to VI$_{3}$. A group theoretical analysis suggests a structural transition from rhombohedral $R\overline{3}$ to triclinic $P\overline{1}$ or $P1$. This transition is significant as it suggests the formation of two distinct crystallographyically inequivalent V$^{3+}$ sites, each with distinct spin-orbital properties. Neutron spectroscopy provides evidence for dominant magnetic exchange coupling only between symmetry-equivalent sites in the triclinc unit cell. We suggest this breaks up the low-temperature honeycomb VI$_3$ lattice into two interpenetrating approximately hexagonal planes resulting in a fragmentated honeycomb. Our findings highlight the critical role of magnetoelastic coupling in determining the magnetic and structural phases in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets.

Abstract: Lead-free tin-based halide perovskites are attractive for flexible and environmentally benign optoelectronics, but their application is limited by the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and poor operational stability. Here, we report a flexible CsSnI3 nanowire photodetector that achieves both high near-infrared photoresponse and long-term stability through synergistic aluminium-substrate contact engineering and dipolar interface modification. A 0.2 mm anodized aluminium foil serves as the flexible substrate, where localized laser ablation exposes metallic aluminium regions that act as reductive sites, effectively suppressing Sn2+ oxidation during nanowire growth. Simultaneously, a polar interlayer of 3-fluoro-2-nitroanisole is introduced to improve energy-level alignment, suppress interfacial deprotonation, and enhance charge extraction. The resulting device exhibits a responsivity of 0.39 A W-1, a specific detectivity of 1.38 * 10^13 Jones, and a wide linear dynamic range of 156 dB under 850 nm illumination. Moreover, the device retains over 85% of its initial photocurrent after 60 days in ambient air and maintains 94% of its initial photocurrent after 1000 bending cycles. This work establishes an effective strategy for stabilizing Sn-based perovskites toward high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $Γ$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.

Abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials enable extreme light confinement and control of photonic states, but their realization has been restricted to inorganic architectures. Here, a fully organic route to fabricate artificial hyperbolic metamaterials based on multilayered thin films of J-aggregate carbocyanine dyes alternated with polyelectrolytes is introduced. These structures exhibit strong optical anisotropy and experimentally support hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons and, for selected dyes, additional surface waves in near-zero permittivity regimes. Spectroscopic ellipsometry confirms a uniaxial dielectric tensor with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane components, close to the absorption peaks of the constituent J-aggregates. This anisotropy is preserved across individual layers, demonstrating the robustness of the layer-by-layer approach and enabling the coupling of surface exciton polaritons and near-zero permittivity modes even in films only a few nanometres thick. Transfer-matrix simulations based on the obtained dielectric tensor reproduce the coupling conditions for all thicknesses, validating the optical model. Structural characterization reveals the link between optical anisotropy and supramolecular order, with preferential in-plane molecular orientation and the evolution from discrete nanostructures to continuous films as deposition progresses. These organic hyperbolic metamaterial architectures, associated with narrow excitonic resonances from J-aggregates, offer a unique platform for tailoring emission, energy transport, and exploring polariton dynamics at the nanoscale.

Abstract: Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (OFDFT) has re-emerged as a viable alternative to Kohn-Sham DFT, driven by recent advances in kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs). Nonlocal (NL) KEDFs have significantly extended OFDFT's applicability, particularly for bulk solids, but their high computational cost and dependence of system-specific parameters limit their universality. In this work, we propose a semilocal KEDF at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) level that achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art NL and meta-GGA functionals, while remaining entirely parameter-free. Our construction revives the Thomas-Fermi-von Weizsacker (TFvW) framework by modulating the relative contributions of TF and vW terms through physically motivated constraints and preserving the exact second-order gradient expansion. Despite its simple form, the proposed functional (KGE2) performs remarkably well across both extended systems (metals and semiconductors) and finite systems (clusters), without any need for parameter tuning. These results mark a step toward a transferable, computationally efficient, and general-purpose KEDF suitable for large-scale OFDFT simulations.

Abstract: We uncover a generic mechanism through which the intrinsic geometry of multifractal quantum wavefunctions generates effective all-to-all interactions in many-body systems. By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种存在于多体福克空间中的非厄米趋肤效应（FSSE），并展示了如何利用它在里德堡原子阵列系统中制备出奇异的量子自旋液体态。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探索一种新的机制，即利用非厄米物理，来有效制备和调控奇异的量子多体物相，例如量子自旋液体。

Method: 论文使用量子二聚体模型对福克空间趋肤效应（FSSE）进行解析和数值表征，并提出了一个在里德堡原子阵列中实现该效应的具体方案。该方案通过里德堡阻塞机制实现二聚体约束，并利用定向“储库”产生非厄米翻转。

Conclusion: 福克空间中的非厄米性是一种强大的基本原理，可用于设计奇异的量子物相和开发动态的状态制备方案。

Abstract: We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 本文研究了一维相互作用电子中的磁性杂质，发现电子间的相互作用（吸引或排斥）可以决定系统是表现出磁性排序（RKKY物理）还是杂质被屏蔽（近藤物理）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在理解在一维相互作用电子系统中，当存在一排规则排列的磁性杂质时，电子间的相互作用如何影响近藤（Kondo）效应和RKKY这两种竞争性的磁性物理现象。

Method: 本文采用玻色化方法来研究一维相互作用电子系统（拉廷格液体）。通过找到两个相互作用参数的特殊值，作者将这个复杂的模型“重新费米化”，转化为了一个等效的、无相互作用的电子能带与一组共振能级杂化的可解模型。

Result: 在找到的两个可解极限下，论文计算了杂质的关联函数。计算结果表明，系统可以呈现两种截然不同的物理状态：一种是扩展的代数有序（对应于RKKY物理），另一种是局域的屏蔽效应（对应于近藤物理）。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了电子间的相互作用（吸引或排斥）可以调控并稳定两种不同的物理现象：当电子间相互作用为排斥时，系统倾向于呈现RKKY磁序；当相互作用为吸引时，则更倾向于形成近藤（Kondo）屏蔽。

Abstract: We address the physics of a regular arrangement of independent magnetic impurities embedded in a band of interacting electrons. We focus on the one-dimensional case that can be studied using bosonization and in which the electron bulk is described by a Luttinger liquid. The impurity spins interact with the electrons via magnetic exchange that introduces the possibility of Kondo and RKKY physics. We find that for two special values of the interactions, the model can be refermionized as a non-interacting electron band hybridized with a regular array of resonant levels. These solvable limits provide access to impurity correlators that correspond to either extended algebraic order or local screening. A physical picture emerges of how the interelectron interactions can stabilize either Kondo or RKKY physics depending on the sign of the interaction.

Abstract: We present a semi-automated method for obtaining an initial estimate of Wannier functions, designed to facilitate the construction of Wannier functions for describing low-energy effective models of solids, particularly those relevant to strongly correlated electron systems. Our approach automatically determines the hydrogenic projections orbitals and the center of the Wannier functions from information on Bloch wavefunctions at the $Γ$ point. This method is integrated into cif2qewan, enabling seamless generation of input files for Quantum ESPRESSO and Wannier90. We validate our method through applications to both inorganic and organic compounds, such as Si, SrVO$_3$, FeSe, Na$_8$Al$_6$Si$_6$O$_{24}$, and (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$. The obtained results demonstrate that our semi-automated projections give a good initial estimate of the Wannier functions. We also show the comparisons with other methods for estimating the initial states of the Wannier functions, such as the Selected Columns of the Density Matrix (SCDM). Our methodology shows an efficient way to construct Wannier functions, paving the way for high-throughput calculations in the study of complex materials.

Conclusion: 本文提出的新方法是一种有前途的、计算成本为多项式级别的替代方案。它能够稳定地为强相关系统提供高质量的能量和密度矩阵，克服了传统高精度方法的计算瓶颈和现有近似方法的缺陷。

Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly-correlated electronic systems, but has combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner approximation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse.

Abstract: Detecting Kitaev interactions in real materials remains challenge, as conventional experimental techniques often have difficulty distinguishing fractionalized excitations from other normal contributions. Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers a novel approach for probing many-body phenomena, such as exotic excitations in quantum magnets. Motivated by recent experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and the development of the terahertz spectroscopy in Kitaev quantum spin liquid, we proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and determined the precise twist angle according to experimental specific-heat phase diagram. With this calibrated model, we found that non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals appear in the 2DCS nonlinear response. The $x$ and $y$ components of the spin superexchange interactions split the rephasing signals into a grid of discrete peaks. We further demonstrate that the diagonal and the discrete rephasing signals primarily originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes based on numerical projection method. These findings indicate that even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials can be effectively detected via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy .

Abstract: Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.

Abstract: We study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) combined with a corner transfer matrix renormalization group scheme adapted to $C_3$-symmetric lattices. Focusing on the fully antiferromagnetic $J$-$J_d$ model with $J_h = J_t := J$, we map out the ground-state phase diagram as a function of the dimer coupling $J_d$. Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.

Abstract: Present article has addressed finite magnetic field extension of previous work by Cho et al. (Phys. Rev. B 108, 235172, 2023) on microscopic calculation of shear viscosity for electron fluid in graphene system. Our calculation is based on the kinetic theory approach in the relaxation time approximation. In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively. They may be considered as required magnetic field strength in three different fluid systems to observe noticeable magnetic field response in their shear viscosity coefficients.

Abstract: We propose a ground state entanglement probe for gapped, two-dimensional quantum many-body systems that involves taking powers of reduced density matrices in a particular geometric configuration. This quantity, which we denote by $ω_{α,β}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $α, β$, and can be seen as a ``Rényi-like" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $ω_{α,β}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $ω_{α,β}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $α$ and $β$, our quantity $ω_{α,β}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $ω_{α,β}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments.

Motivation: 为中小型项目提供一个快速的计算工作流程和直观的图形用户界面，以简化中子环境的模拟，避免现有专业软件包所需的广泛建模和培训。

Method: 该研究开发了一个名为URANOS的3D中子输运蒙特卡洛代码。它采用基于体素引擎的光线投射算法，通过层叠的像素矩阵图片来定义复杂的几何形状。该代码模拟了从热能到快能区的中子散射、吸收等物理过程，并集成了对硼衬探测器中带电粒子输运和能量损失的计算。所有设置均可通过图形用户界面进行调整。

Result: 成功开发了一款名为URANOS的自由可用软件。该软件提供了一个易于访问和相对简单的界面，能够处理复杂的几何形状，可用于模拟硼衬或超热中子探测器的响应函数、小型实验室设置以及宇宙射线引起的环境中子输运研究。

Conclusion: URANOS为科研仪器中的中子环境理解和模拟提供了一种新的可能性，它降低了对复杂专用软件包进行广泛建模和培训的需求，为中小型项目提供了一个高效且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: URANOS is a newly developed 3D neutron transport Monte-Carlo code from thermal to fast energy domains. It was originally developed for the CASCADE detector. The purpose of this simulation program is to provide a fast computational workflow and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for small to medium-sized projects. It features a ray-casting algorithm based on a voxel engine. The simulation domain is defined layerwise, whereas the geometry is extruded from a pixel matrix of materials, identified by specific numbers. Input files are a stack of pictures, all other settings, including the configuration of predefined sources, can be adjusted via the GUI. The scattering kernel features the treatment of elastic and inelastic collisions, absorption and absorption-like processes like evaporation. Cross sections, energy distributions and angular distributions are taken from evaluated data bases. In order to simulate boron-lined detectors it also models the charged particle transport following the conversion by computing the energy loss in the boron and its consecutive layer. The electron track is then projected onto a readout unit by longitudinal and transversal diffusion. URANOS is freely available and can be used to simulate the response function of boron-lined or epithermal neutron detectors, small-scale laboratory setups and especially transport studies of cosmic-ray induced environmental neutrons. It offers an easy accessibility and comparably simple interface capable of handling complex geometries. URANOS therefore offers possibilities to understand and simulate the neutron environment at instruments, which would otherwise require extensive modeling and training on dedicated packages.

TL;DR: 本文使用非平衡分子动力学方法，研究了正十二烷和氮气混合物在近临界温度下的气液界面质量传输现象。研究发现，温度升高虽然增强了分子活动，但由于反射通量的增加，净蒸发效率反而下降。该研究为建立复杂混合物的动力学边界条件（KBCs）提供了重要数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的连续介质模型在高温高压下无法准确描述气液界面的热力学性质。虽然动力学边界条件（KBCs）是一种改进方法，但先前的研究主要集中在单原子流体，缺乏对如碳氢化合物和氮气这类复杂二元混合物的适用性研究。

Method: 研究采用非平衡分子动力学（NEMD）模拟方法，在近临界温度下研究正十二烷和氮气的III型二元混合物。通过分析界面厚度、密度梯度和表面张力等属性，重点观察蒸发和反射质量通量随时间的变化。

Result: 研究发现，随着温度升高，蒸发通量和反射通量均增加，表明分子活动加剧。然而，蒸发系数（α_evap）却随温度升高而下降（从约0.978降至约0.905），原因是反射通量的增加超过了蒸发通量的增加，从而降低了蒸发的净效率。

Conclusion: 这项研究是为数不多估算III型二元系统（特别是碳氢化合物和氮气混合物）质量传输系数的研究之一，为建立这类混合物的动力学边界条件（KBCs）奠定了基础。

Abstract: The study of interfacial fluxes under evaporative or condensation processes are ubiquitous in thermal systems, propulsion devices, and many other engineering applications. Most continuum scale models fail to capture the true nature of thermodynamic property variation across the interface, particularly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. An improvement over the sharp interface assumption of such continuum scale models is the consideration of a diffused interface and using Kinetic Boundary Conditions (KBCs) to model the mass-transport across the liquid vapor interface. Prior studies on KBCs mainly address monoatomic fluids. Two of the main ingredients required to form KBCs are: density and mass flux. Here, we study a Type-III binary mixture of n-dodecane and nitrogen using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at near-critical temperatures. Interfacial properties such as thickness, density gradient, and surface tension were analyzed. A key result is the temporal evolution of the evaporation and reflected mass fluxes across the vapor-liquid interface. We observe that both the evaporation and reflection fluxes increase with increasing temperature, indicating enhanced molecular activity and mass transport across the interface at higher Tr. In contrast, the evaporation coefficient alpha_evap decreases from about alpha approximately 0.978 at Tr equals 0.70 to alpha approximately 0.905 at Tr equals 0.95 because the reflected-out flux increases along with the evaporation flux, which reduces the net efficiency of molecular evaporation across the interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the very few studies estimating mass transport coefficients for Type-III binary systems, laying the foundation for KBCs in hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures.

Motivation: 对流固耦合进行计算建模是航空航天工程的基石。然而，现有方法在处理复杂几何体、非平衡流效应（如速度滑移和温度跳跃）时，常在精度、稳定性和灵活性上遇到挑战。因此，亟需一种既准确又高效，且能轻松处理任意几何边界的统一模拟框架。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法在物理和速度空间均达到二阶精度，并具有良好的数值稳定性。数值实验表明，该算法的预测精度可与传统的贴体网格求解器相媲美，同时保持了笛卡尔网格方法的简洁、灵活和可扩展的优点。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个统一且物理一致的浸入边界框架，能够模拟多种流态下的非平衡流与结构间的动态相互作用，兼具高精度与笛卡尔网格方法的简便性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Computational modeling and simulation of fluid-structure interactions constitute a fundamental cornerstone for advancing aerospace engineering endeavors. This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes.

Method: 使用真实的设备建模和数值模拟方法，研究了一个基于 Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si 双阱异质结构的垂直双量子点（DQD）系统。

Result: 模拟发现，该结构中存在由应变和自旋轨道相互作用引起的g张量变化，以及较大的谷分裂（约250μeV）。这些特性催生了多种快速的单比特电控方案：1）电偶极子自旋共振（EDSR）；2）通过栅极电压调控g因子实现的电控电子自旋共振（ESR）；3）在量子点之间穿梭电子，可实现亚纳秒级的超快量子门操作。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的垂直双量子点（DQD）架构能够完全替代微磁体，实现对自旋量子比特的快速全电学控制，这极大地促进了 Loss-DiVincenzo 自旋量子比特在半导体代工厂中的可扩展性。

Abstract: We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,μ$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.

Motivation: 尽管手性拓扑外尔半金属（TSM）已被广泛研究，但传统观点认为其拓扑态在真实材料的无序和缺陷下会消失，这限制了其应用。本文旨在挑战这一观点，探索手性TSM是否能在强无序甚至非晶材料中稳定存在。

Abstract: Since the prediction and observation of topological Weyl semimetals (chiral TSMs), there have been enormous efforts to characterize further condensed matter realizations of chiral fermions. These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum devices using surface acoustic waves show promise as key elements of quantum information processors. We report measurements of integrated flip-chip devices consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and surface acoustic wave resonators in lithium niobate. We observed that the pyroelectric effect in lithium niobate inhibited the operation of quantum dots in the integrated devices. GaAs/AlGaAs devices suffered from unintentional carrier depletion, and Si/SiGe devices suffered from electrostatic discharge. Our results highlight the importance of mitigating pyroelectric effects in semiconductor-lithium niobate hybrid devices for continued progress in quantum interconnects and transducers.

Abstract: Superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells (QWs) offer a promising platform for hybrid quantum devices. Yet, in the most common heterostructure architectures, they have so far been limited by sizable photon losses. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of microwave resonators patterned in the Al thin film of an in-situ grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure (HS). The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i>1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT. A hysteresis emerges in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence, for both the resonance frequency and the quality factor, indicating an interesting interplay between vortex- and quasiparticle loss mechanisms.

TL;DR: 该论文通过光学技术研究了砷化镓（GaAs）量子阱中的核自旋极化，在极低温下实现了巨大的等效磁场，并观察到一种动态自极化效应，从而将核自旋系统冷却到了纳开尔文（nK）级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在探究在名义上未掺杂的砷化镓（GaAs）/铝镓砷（AlGaAs）量子阱中的动态核自旋极化现象，特别是在低至毫开尔文（mK）的极低温区的行为，这对于自旋电子学和量子信息处理等领域至关重要。

Method: 研究人员使用了两种互补的实验方法：1) 时间分辨克尔旋转（TRKR），用于在1.6 K温度下测量Overhauser场；2) 光致发光的光学取向，用于在低至300 mK的毫开尔文温度下研究核自旋动力学。他们还采用了从0.6 T到0.006 T的绝热磁场扫描来冷却核自旋系统。

Result: 在1.6 K时，研究人员测量到一个高达3.1 T的巨大Overhauser场，并通过绝热扫描将核自旋温度冷却至6.4 μK。在500 mK的更低温度下，他们观察到160 mT的Overhauser场，建立时间为150秒。当温度进一步降低到500 mK及300 mK时，发现了核自旋的动态自极化现象，估计在该状态下核自旋温度可低至200 nK。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地在液氦温度和毫开尔文温度下展示了GaAs量子阱中强烈的动态核自旋极化。研究结果确认了自旋温度理论在此类纳米结构中的适用性。在极低温下观察到的动态自极化现象，为实现可达纳开尔文级别的极低核自旋温度开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We investigate the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a nominally undoped GaAs/Al$_{0.35}$Ga$_{0.65}$As quantum well using two complementary experimental approaches: time-resolved Kerr rotation and optical orientation measurements of photoluminescence. Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $μ$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS), spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Sn intercalation effectively decouples the buffer layer, yielding quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) while introducing local lattice distortions. Bias-dependent STM imaging revealed the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, governed by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction at the SiC interface. The measured STS spectra exhibit good agreement with DFT results. However, achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains remains challenging, apparently, due to strain within the Sn monolayer, which drives the emergence of Kekule distortions and the associated electronic band-gap opening omogeneously in graphene. These findings highlight the crucial role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning graphene`s structural and electronic properties.

Abstract: Flat bands in graphitic materials emerged as a platform for realizing tunable correlated physics. As a nodal-line semimetal, rhombohedral graphite features flat drumhead surface states in the vicinity of the Dirac points, which carry a nontrivial topological charge. We present a comprehensive study on rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults. Using both the continuum models and the realistic tight-binding models, we show that the twist angle between the graphene layers can tune the interface states at such stacking faults. The evolution of interface states originates from the interplay between the moiré periodicity and Zak phase topology, predicting the occurrence of nearly flat bands throughout the moiré Brillouin zone. We further investigate the disorder-induced layer polarization and tunable Chern number for flat band, and characterize the relationship between the disorder strength and Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moiré magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moiré excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.

Abstract: The spin dynamics of localized electrons in bulk semiconductors is governed by the interplay of effective nuclear field fluctuations, spin exchange between electrons, and spin transitions into the conduction band. Using spin noise spectroscopy, we reveal this interplay for donor-bound electrons in a CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well and spectrally separate electron spin relaxation and dephasing in zero magnetic field. We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples. The theoretical analysis of the spin noise power and the strength of the spin exchange interaction provides the estimation of the donor concentration in our unintentionally doped structure.

Abstract: Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.

Abstract: Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.
