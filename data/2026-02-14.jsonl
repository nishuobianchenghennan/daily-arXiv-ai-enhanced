Consequently, future prospects could probe new physics whose contribution to the electron EDM first arises at three-loop order. Additional SU(2)$_L$ multiplets with CP-violating Yukawa interactions, which contribute to the electron EDM at three-loop level, is one such testable new physics scenario. In this scenario, the electron EDM is radiatively induced from two contributions: the CP-odd trilinear $W$-boson coupling, called the electroweak-Weinberg operator, and the CP-odd dipole operator of electron. The former and the latter operators are generated at two-loop and three-loop levels, respectively, after integrating out the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. Within the same models, according to an analysis based on the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we previously found that the contribution to the electron EDM from the electroweak-Weinberg operator can be probed in future experiments. However, the one-loop matching condition between the electron EDM and the electroweak-Weinberg operator does not receive a large logarithmic enhancement because the associated anomalous dimension is zero. The CP-odd dipole operator of the electron would contribute to the electron EDM at the same three-loop order as the contribution through the electroweak-Weinberg operator. In this paper, we directly calculate the electron EDM induced by the CP-violating Yukawa interactions of the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets at full three-loop level. A central result is that the full three-loop calculation is a factor of three larger than that of the electroweak-Weinberg operator alone."}
