In this framework, conversion, semi-annihilation, and (when kinematically allowed) $S_B\\to S_A S_A$ decays shape the coupled relic-density evolution. Imposing theoretical consistency, Higgs invisible-decay limits, and the latest LZ spin-independent bound with the standard relic-fraction rescaling, we show that the severe exclusions typical of thermal two-WIMP analyses are largely an artefact of requiring both components to thermalise with the SM bath. Mixed WIMP-FIMP (and fully feeble FIMP-FIMP) histories reopen regions excluded in thermal two-WIMP interpretations, since the total relic density can be shared while the direct-detection signal is carried only by the thermal fraction. For the unstable hierarchy $M_{S_B}>2M_{S_A}$, we identify decay-dominated regimes-SuperWIMP, injection-assisted freeze-out, and sequential freeze-in (``SuperFIMP'')-where late dark-sector injection sets the final $S_A$ abundance. These results establish the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ Higgs-portal model as a controlled benchmark for multi-component dark matter beyond the two-thermal-relic assumption."}

In addition to simple power-law cosmological epochs solutions, we also discuss the behavior of the network during the radiation-to-matter and matter-to-acceleration transitions.

Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) offers an attractive data-driven reduction framework, but its operators are trained for a single set of reservoir properties. When permeability or well location changes, conventional practice is to regenerate snapshots and retrain the surrogate, erasing most of the speed advantage. This work presents a lightweight alternative that updates an existing DMD or DMD-with-control model without incorporating new simulation data or retraining. Two complementary update strategies are introduced. For cases where permeability changes uniformly across the domain, the proposed updates adjust the models internal dynamics and control response to match the new flow timescale. When permeability varies in space, the approach modifies the spatial representation so that high-permeability zones are given greater influence on the models reduced basis. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed updates recover plume migration and pressure build-up within three percent of a freshly trained surrogate yet execute hundreds of times faster than full retraining. These methods therefore enable real-time optimization and rapid what-if studies while preserving the physical fidelity demanded by carbon-storage workflows."}

Typically, the imaginary-time Green's function is generated by Monte Carlo methods. As the one-point fermionic kernel diverges exponentially for large frequencies, numerical noise generically causes instabilities. We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians. We improve the training data set available by including collision centers for the Gaussians rather than employing uniformly distributed Gaussians. Our network is constructed in such a way that its output fulfills positive semidefiniteness. We compare the results of our network with results of the Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt), a standard method for the same reconstruction problem for the spectral density. This comparison is performed for three different cases, namely our Gaussian based test data as well as two physical models, the 1d Hubbard model showing spin-charge separation, and the two-dimensional SSH model in the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the network outperforms MaxEnt when presented data close to the training set. For the physical models considered, MaxEnt recognizes physical features more precisely as compared to our network prediction. While it is hard to improve MaxEnt, the quality of the network depends on the training data set which can be systematically enhanced and improved."}

Ganesh", "K. V. Samokhin"], "title": "Transport in close-packed solids with stacking defects", "comment": "18 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Lithium and sodium are the only solids that are known to lose crystalline order upon cooling. The seemingly-disordered low-temperature phase shows signatures of various close-packed structures. The lack of order has been attributed to a hidden gauge symmetry that arises when electrons from one layer can hop to a neighbouring layer but not further. It makes all close-packed structures nearly degenerate and leads to ``structural frustration''. In this article, we examine whether this symmetry is reflected in transport signatures. Taking advantage of in-plane translational periodicity, we map the bulk Bloch Hamiltonian to an effective one-dimensional chain, with stacking disorder mapping to random phases of the hopping amplitudes. We derive an explicit analytic form for the Green's function of electrons and use it to calculate conductance of a bulk crystal. When hopping in the effective one-dimensional chain is restricted to nearest neighbours, conductance is completely insensitive to phase disorder, which indicates that all close-packed structures exhibit the same conductance. We show that the leading correction that can differentiate between close-packed structures arises from hopping to the next-nearest-neighbour layer, equivalent to second-neighbour hopping in the chain model. This process appears when a pair of next-neighbour layers are aligned in a certain way, e.g., at an hcp-like stacking fault within an fcc background. With this hopping included, conductance becomes sensitive to the precise arrangement of layers. When multiple stacking faults are present, the conductance decreases with increasing system size, as expected from Anderson localization. Our results are applicable to pressurized lithium and sodium, where conductance measurements can identify and characterize stacking faults."}

While intralayer exchange interaction favors AM ordering in a single ILL layer across the entire family, the relatively weak interlayer coupling in most cases favors Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic order with a doubled magnetic unit cell. This means that most stoichiometric bulk materials, including the previously proposed candidate KV2Se2O, are not altermagnetic, with CsV2Te2O being the only exception.

A key innovation is a two-stage parameter estimation strategy that decouples noise filtering from physical parameter extraction: the GP first smooths noisy data through standard prediction, then Langmuir parameters are fitted to the noise-filtered GP predictions. This approach effectively separates signal from experimental noise. We evaluate the framework against a standard data-driven GP across four simulated regimes, demonstrating convergence within five iterations, up to fourfold improvement in prediction accuracy, and two to fourfold reduction in precursor usage. Experimental validation using TiO2 deposition via Tetrakisdimethylamido Titanium (TDMAT) and ozone confirms that the physics-informed model accurately identifies saturation times for high-coverage targets ($\\geq$95\\%), with observed deviations at lower saturation levels providing valuable insight into non-ideal desorption behaviors."}

In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes.

To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $γ$ and $δ$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites."}

Probing these nonequilibrium processes requires access to the thermodynamic limit, where the number of lattice sites becomes arbitrarily large, but conventional solvers are constrained to small systems due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), originally developed for solving partial differential equations, naturally accommodate inputs of varying resolution and are capable of capturing nonlocal effects. Here, we employ FNOs to learn the mapping from noise-perturbed ground-state momentum distributions to their post-pulse counterparts across a range of interaction strengths and driving parameters. Trained only on small lattices, the model generalizes zero-shot to much larger systems, producing physically reasonable momentum distributions well beyond the reach of numerical solvers. Specifically, the model can predict momentum distribution for a 1024x1024 system within a few seconds that matches the theoretical behavior of key observables, whereas direct numerical simulations have so far been restricted to edge sizes of ~30. These results demonstrate the potential of neural operators to directly access large-scale nonequilibrium dynamics, providing a new pathway toward the thermodynamic limit in strongly correlated materials."}

Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts.

While gauge-invariant quantities can be evaluated from overlap matrices between neighboring $k$ points, accessing the Berry connection itself as a smooth field requires specifying a continuous gauge over the Brillouin zone. Wannier-based workflows achieve this through projection onto localized orbitals, enabling stable evaluation of geometric quantities and response functions. In this setting, the Berry connection enters directly in Wannier-interpolated calculations of polarization, Berry curvature, optical conductivity, and related response functions. In practical implementations, however, the projection-gauge Berry connection is typically constructed from finite-difference overlaps between neighboring $k$ points, discretizing momentum derivatives and introducing errors tied to $k$-mesh spacing and gauge alignment. These effects can become numerically delicate in systems with small band gaps or when evaluating higher-order responses such as the Chern-Simons axion angle. Here, we derive an exact expression for the non-Abelian Berry connection in the projection gauge that is local in crystal momentum. Starting from projected and orthonormalized Bloch-like states, we obtain a closed-form equation expressed entirely in terms of $k$-local quantities. We validate the formulation in one and three dimensions by computing the Berry phase and Chern-Simons axion angle in tight-binding models. The resulting framework provides a stable route to evaluating geometric properties within Wannier interpolation schemes and future first-principles implementations."}

While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position."}

Using ReaxFF-based reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations with extensive statistical validation, we performed temperature-ramp MD simulations of pristine and functionalized N-carbophenes. We demonstrate that N-carbophenes remain stable up to temperatures above 1000 K. The phase-change onset temperatures decrease as the N-phenylene chain length increases in pristine N-carbophenes, attributed to increasing antiaromaticity in the central phenylene segments, thereby contributing to the foundational understanding of aromatic versus antiaromatic bonding in 2D carbon networks, a topic of considerable interest in theoretical chemistry. Pristine N-carbophenes exhibit negative area thermal expansion (NATE), whereas functional groups modulate this, leading to either negative or positive expansion. Functional groups remain stably bonded well above the transition temperature. We also show that a temperature-induced phase transition from graphenylene (2-carbophene) to γ-graphyne is possible. Our results provide upper bounds on N-carbophene stability, clarify the relationships between structure and thermal properties, and identify a new transformation pathway.

We investigate a spin-1/2 ladder with asymmetric XY leg couplings and tunable Ising interactions on the rungs, and identify the microscopic origin of many-body localization (MBL) in this setting. Through a suite of diagnostics -including entanglement dynamics, fidelity susceptibility, adiabatic gauge potential norms, level-spacing statistics and entropy of eigenstates- we uncover a reentrant progression of dynamical regimes as the rung coupling Jz is varied: integrable behavior at Jz=0, quantum chaos at intermediate Jz, and a robust nonthermal regime at strong coupling. In the latter regime, we demonstrate the emergence of a reversed quantum disentangled liquid (reversed-QDL), where the light species thermalizes while the heavy species remains localized. The strong-coupling limit further yields emergent local integrals of motion anchored in a fixed-point structure, providing a microscopic origin of the observed quasi-MBL dynamics. These results establish reversed-QDL as a distinct, disorder-free route to nonergodicity and broaden the classification of dynamical phases in quantum matter."}

In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes.

Using an atomistic model, we show that skyrmion velocity and Hall angle dependence is anisotropic with respect to the direction of the drive, due to the fourfold symmetry implied by the two sublattices of the altermagnet. The skyrmion Hall angle and velocity at fixed drive show strong variations for increasing ratios of the exchange constant of the sublattices, $J_2/J_1$. This fourfold anisotropy of altermagnetic (ATM) skyrmions also leads to anisotropic pinning effects for an ATM skyrmion interacting with isotropic circular pinning sites. We also propose a simple particle model for this system that takes into account this anisotropy and find that it captures both the variations of the ATM skyrmion Hall angle and velocity as a function of drive direction, as also found in the atomistic simulations. Using this particle model, we examine ATM skyrmions interacting with a periodic array of pinning sites. For increasing ratios of $J_2/J_1$, we find a strongly non-monotonic ATM skyrmion velocity, where there is a minimum in the velocity where the skyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the periodic pinning lattice. For a random array, we find that ATM skyrmions show strongly anisotropic depinning thresholds and velocity responses for different drive directions, and that the Hall angle is nearly constant with drive. In comparison, for the same parameters, the depinning threshold for a ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion is lower, and the skyrmion Hall angle shows a strong velocity dependence. The lower depinning threshold for FM skyrmions is due to stronger Magnus forces."}

Conventional frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) techniques, while proficient at evaluating cross-plane thermal conductivity, suffer from restricted capability in resolving in-plane transport due to inherent phase-delay constraints and inadequate lateral resolution. In this investigation, we establish a non-contact beam-offset FDTR (BO-FDTR) approach that concurrently determines both directional thermal conductivities within layered semiconductor architectures. Our methodology implements spatial separation between excitation and detection beams while utilizing coupled normalized amplitude and phase responses as analytical inputs, thereby improving discrimination between anisotropic thermal parameters. We combine this experimental configuration with a Bayesian optimization scheme incorporating Gaussian Process Regression (BO-GPR) to reduce estimation inaccuracies, attaining measurement uncertainties under 1% to 2% at 95% confidence intervals. This technique demonstrates particular efficacy for intricate multilayer nanostructures, furnishing a structured protocol for superlattice thermal evaluation. Experimental characterization of an AlAs/GaAs superlattice (period thickness 52 nm) delivers thermal conductivity values of 14.7 W m-1 K-1 (cross-plane) and 37.4 W m-1 K-1 (in-plane). Our findings indicate that integrating frequency sweeps with varied beam offset locations yields superior measurement precision, exceeding conventional single-variable methods and confirming thermal assessment validity across both geometric arrangements."}

Events are classified using the relative transverse activity observable $R_{\\mathrm{T}}$, which provides a differential characterization of predominantly soft underlying-event (UE) activity. A finite long-range near-side component emerges in the charge-independent correlator $R_{2}^{\\mathrm{CI}}$ for UE-dominated events ($2.5 < R_{\\mathrm{T}} \\leq 5.0$), whereas no corresponding long-range structure is observed in the charge-dependent correlators.

The most intriguing example of such a phase is light-induced superconductivity (SC) in non-superconducting materials. However, realizing unconventional SC at commensurate half-filling remains a formidable challenge even in non-equilibrium, as the regime is typically dominated by the robust stability of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating (MI) state. Here, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize unconventional d-wave SC in a half-filled system through Floquet engineering. We analyze the periodically driven Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a high-frequency drive can transform a weakly interacting insulator into a regime of strong correlations by the drive-induced renormalization of nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, the drive induces staggered higher range hoppings that can frustrate the AFM order while simultaneously generate staggered potential that lifts the kinetic constraints inherent to the half-filled system, fostering the charge dynamics required to stabilize d-wave pairing against the competing AFM state. The resulting SC phase is protected by high-frequency prethermalization, maintaining stability over timescales exponentially large in the drive frequency. This protocol circumvents the need for chemical doping, offering a 'disorder-free' alternative for realizing unconventional pairing with direct applications in optimizing the performance of superconducting quantum computers, qubit arrays and other upcoming quantum technologies."}

The proposed detector would employ a gaseous time-projection chamber with a highly segmented charge readout to enable the spatial reconstruction of $\\sim$10-500 keV ionisation tracks created by CEvNS-induced recoils. This would enable the simultaneous measurement of the CEvNS recoil energy and scattering angle, thereby allowing event-by-event reconstruction of the neutrino energy. We estimate that a 60:40 He:CF$_4$ gas mixture at atmospheric pressure offers a good trade-off between total target mass and good directionality and could deliver a detection of the angular distribution of CEvNS, even under pessimistic background conditions. We project the sensitivity of 1 and 10 m$^3$-scale detectors in the context of several physics cases, including: the measurement of the Standard Model CEvNS cross section, reconstruction of the flavour-dependent neutrino fluxes, observing the neutrino-induced Migdal effect, constraints on beyond-Standard Model neutrino interactions, and probing 10-eV-scale sterile neutrinos."}

However, L-PBF alloys often display much lower fracture toughness, in some cases up to 70% below conventionally wrought counterparts. The reasons for this toughness paradox have remained elusive, since conventional tools cannot directly visualize sub-surface microscale deformation processes that govern crack growth. Here we apply scanning 3D X-ray diffraction and phase contrast tomography to simultaneously capture microstructural evolution with 1 micron resolution near an advancing crack tip, utilizing 316L stainless steel as a model system. We demonstrate that the toughness paradox is not solely a consequence of extrinsic processing defects or residual stresses, but rather an intrinsic failure to relax crack-tip stresses via plasticity. While wrought material facilitates stable crack-tip blunting through localized dislocation accumulation, the L-PBF material undergoes premature work-hardening saturation that triggers extreme stress partitioning and high stress triaxiality. This results in a transition from ductile blunting to a sharp, unstable fracture mode. These findings identify work-hardening exhaustion as a systemic vulnerability inherent to L-PBF microstructures, where the exceptional initial dislocation density required for high yield strength acts as a saturation ceiling for damage tolerance. This work provides a physical basis for adapting damage models to L-PBF metals and challenges the assumption that high tensile ductility guarantees fracture resistance in rapidly solidified components."}

The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.\n  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.\n  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program."}

Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents."}

Our system is a honeycomb nanoribbon heterostructure with armchair edges, consisting of a central Rashba spin-orbit coupled (SOC) region sandwiched between two pristine armchair nanoribbons. As the strength of Rashba SOC is increased, topological edge states exhibit at the interface between the Rashba SOC and pristine armchair honeycomb nanoribbon (ANR), and these edge states remain robust under edge perturbations. In addition, we find that for a finite width ANR, Rashba SOC can open/close a gap depending on its strength, which leads to a topological phase transition. This work provides an alternative perspective on how Rashba SOC influences topological properties."}

This framework is further extended to predict the electrical resistivity $ρ$, thermal conductivity $κ$ and the specific heat capacity Cp of BCC alloys in the temperature range of 300-1300 K and the results are validated against experimental data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this model by using it to predict the thermo-electric properties of a concentrated W53Ta42V5 alloy which shows a saturation in the electrical resistivity $ρ$ in the temperature range 300K-1300K. This model is then used to predict the properties of another concentrated Nb$_4$0Mo$_4$0Ta$_2$0 alloy in the same temperature regime."}

We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with Néel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering."}

While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation."}

In this Letter, we revisit its low-energy structural landscape using a systematic first-principles structural search based on symmetry-adapted phonon-mode theory. We uncover a previously unreported chiral ferroelectric phase with space group $R3$, which exhibits a large spontaneous polarization and a low polarization switching barrier, enabling polarization reversal under electric fields. Crucially, the structural chirality of this phase is intrinsically locked to the ferroelectric polarization, allowing electrical control of the chiral handedness. Consequently, chiral optical responses--including circular dichroism, circular photogalvanic effect, optical activity, and second-order nonlinear optics--can be reversibly switched by an external electric field. These results not only clarify the complex low-temperature structural behavior of AgNbO$_3$ but also establish a rare purely inorganic platform for electric-field-tunable chirality, opening a pathway toward ultrafast, electrically controlled chiral optoelectronics."}

However, no laser is absolutely ideal and the implications of deviations from perfect coherence in quantum technological tasks remain unclear. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally explore the quantum coherence properties of lasers from a resource theory perspective, establishing a significant connection between photonics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. We demonstrate that the maximum achievable quantum coherence for laser light is constrained by spontaneous emission and the purity of the dephased laser field state. As a critical example application in quantum information protocols, we show that the quantum coherence of a laser field with a given mean photon number directly governs the maximum purity attainable when initializing a qubit in a superposition state through resonant driving. Our findings are highly relevant for bridging applied physics and engineering with integrated photonic quantum technologies and resource theories, paving the way for reliable benchmarking of various coherent light sources for applications in photonics and quantum protocols."}

Here, we go beyond this paradigm by unveiling the magnetic orbital torque (MOT) that is enabled only by spin-group symmetry breaking of real altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling. This effect enables generating unconventional out-of-plane orbital current with collinear orbital polarization from all 10 spin Laue groups of centrosymmetric altermagnets, which is critical for field-free manipulation of perpendicular magnetization that is a key for next-generation information technology. We reveal perturbative and non-perturbative effects of spin-group symmetry breaking, and unveil that MOT is a much more generic effect of real altermagnets than SST. Our first-principles calculations predict giant out-of-plane MOTs at room temperature in the absence of and competing with SST in experimentally identified altermagnets CrSb and FeSb2, respectively. These findings uncover new fundamental physics in altermagnetic spintronics, and open up broad vistas of altermagnets in magnetic memory."}

The case of an isolated wire as well as of one proximitized by an s-wave superconductor are considered. Already for the normal wire, the presence of spin-orbit coupling leads to eigenstates of the finite system composed of more than two momentum eigenstates. The quantization condition for the wavevectors is not that of a quantum box, but given instead by a transcendental equation linking the involved wavevectors. For the wire with superconducting pairing, the presence of electron and hole channels complicates the composition of the eigenstates. In this case we derive an approximate quantization condition close to the phase boundary, and a condition for the appearance of exact zero energy states. It can be satisfied both in the topological and in the trivial phase. Both the trivial and topological zero energy states contribute to the linear transport through Andreev reflection and direct transmission processes, with their relative importance depending on the degree of the states' localization at the boundary."}

However, the landscape of hadron spectroscopy has been profoundly transformed since the turn of the 21st century with the observation of numerous charmonium-like states, such as $X(3872)$, which exhibit properties starkly at odds with quenched model predictions. These discrepancies, exemplified by the \"$X(3872)$ low-mass puzzle\" and the \"$Y$ problem\" associated with vector states like $Y(4260)$, underscore the critical limitations of the quenched approximation and signal the necessity for a new theoretical paradigm. This review synthesizes recent advances in hadronic spectroscopy, arguing that the unquenched picture, which incorporates coupled-channel effects such as hadronic loops, is essential for a unified description of these new states and associated anomalies. We demonstrate how unquenched effects provide compelling solutions to long-standing puzzles in charmonium decays (e.g., the \"$ρπ$ puzzle\" and anomalous dipion transitions), predict and explain the existence of exotic charged states like $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_b(10610)$ via mechanisms such as Initial Single Pion Emission, and offer a framework for understanding interactions between charmonia and with nucleons. Furthermore, we emphasize the universality of unquenched effects, extending their application to bottomonium and light-flavor sectors. With improving precision, we advocate systematic development of unquenched hadronic spectroscopy."}

While AMFE is well understood in highly cation-selective narrow ion channels, its microscopic origin in wide synthetic nanopores, where anions may also contribute to transport, remains less clear. Here, we use a reduced Nernst-Planck + Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo framework to study ionic transport in a negatively charged PET nanopore, with particular emphasis on how the modeling of surface carboxyl (COO$^{-}$) groups influences charge inversion, ionic currents, and AMFE. We systematically compare fixed point-charge models and explicit-particle representations of surface oxygens and identify two controlling parameters: the distance of closest approach (DCA) between ionic charges and pore charges and grid spacing that modulates localization (while keeping average surface charge constant). By fitting pore diffusion coefficients to three experimental conductance points, we reproduce the entire experimental AMFE curve as well as anion leakage in CaCl$_2$ seen in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, vastly different microscopic models of the surface groups yield indistinguishable device-level conductance curves when the DCA is matched, despite substantial differences in local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that AMFE in wide nanopores is governed by a delicate interplay between charge inversion, anion leakage, and ionic mobility, underlying that in wide pores monovalent vs.\\ divalent cation selectivity is modulated by cations vs.\\ anion selecivity."}

This modification indicates reduction of Bi 6$sp$ - O 2$p$ hybridization and O 2$p$ spectral weight near E$_\\text{F}$. The strong decrement of covalency at lower temperatures is accompanied by a decrement in O 2$p$ hole density due to possible charge transfer from Bi 6$s$ to the O 2$p$ band. Bi-charge state analysis from Bi-4$f$ core-level spectra showed that at 300K, $δ$ (charge difference between alternate Bi sites) value in 4$\\pmδ$ is much less than at 160K, which reveals the transition towards the ionic nature of CD or static CD in BBO at low temperature.

Building on the default Herwig 7 treatment based on the Dawson-subtracted longitudinal current, we construct a gauge-invariant longitudinal scheme in which the Dawson remainder is retained as a well-defined contribution and completed by a Ward-identity-fixed Goldstone-matching term. We derive helicity-resolved building blocks and compact quasi-collinear splitting kernels for $q\\to q'V$ and $V\\to V'V''$ branchings, and implement the scheme in Herwig 7 as a switchable alternative to the default longitudinal basis. The completion leaves the transverse sector unchanged and modifies only longitudinal entries through controlled symmetry-breaking terms, including Yukawa-sensitive contributions in massive-fermion channels. In shower-level studies, we find that the Dawson and gauge-invariant prescriptions coincide at high evolution scales, while differing at lower scales precisely in channels where symmetry breaking is active. Exclusive single-emission observables can moreover display non-monotonic scheme dependence once Sudakov suppression and kinematic constraints are accounted for. A first multi-emission LHC-like study confirms numerical stability and yields controlled, interpretable shifts in observables that probe propagating electroweak shower currents, whereas quantities dominated by promptly contracted, near on-shell vector-boson matrix elements remain largely unchanged."}

In this work, we study leptophilic scalar DM in a $\\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, which provides a common leptophilic portal for all scenarios considered. To reproduce the observed relic abundance while suppressing direct-detection signals, we investigate three benchmark realizations: (i) a secluded DM scenario in which the relic density is set by annihilation into $\\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge bosons, and two pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM models based on (ii) an SO(4) symmetry and (iii) an SO(3) symmetry. In the SO(4) pNGB model, the DM mass arises at tree level from a soft breaking term, while the elastic scattering amplitude is suppressed by a symmetry-protected cancellation. In the SO(3) pNGB model, the DM mass is generated radiatively at one loop via the $\\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_μ-L_τ}$ gauge interaction, and we show that this gauging preserves the same cancellation mechanism, maintaining compatibility with direct-detection null results. We perform a systematic parameter scan imposing relic density, direct- and indirect-detection, and neutrino trident constraints, and identify viable sub-TeV to TeV DM candidates. Assuming maximal capture in NSs, we find that the remaining parameter space can be tested by near-infrared observations of NSs, providing sensitivity complementary to terrestrial searches in regions that are currently weakly constrained."}

We introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) framework that autonomously tunes precursor pulse times by integrating a Langmuir adsorption model directly into the Gaussian Process (GP) kernel. A key innovation is a two-stage parameter estimation strategy that decouples noise filtering from physical parameter extraction: the GP first smooths noisy data through standard prediction, then Langmuir parameters are fitted to the noise-filtered GP predictions. This approach effectively separates signal from experimental noise. We evaluate the framework against a standard data-driven GP across four simulated regimes, demonstrating convergence within five iterations, up to fourfold improvement in prediction accuracy, and two to fourfold reduction in precursor usage. Experimental validation using TiO2 deposition via Tetrakisdimethylamido Titanium (TDMAT) and ozone confirms that the physics-informed model accurately identifies saturation times for high-coverage targets ($\\geq$95\\%), with observed deviations at lower saturation levels providing valuable insight into non-ideal desorption behaviors."}

We present a physics-informed pretraining strategy that leverages simple physical potentials which can improve the robustness and stability of graph-based MLIPs for MD simulations. We demonstrate this approach by deploying a pretraining-finetuning pipeline where MLIPs are initially pretrained on data labelled with embedded atom model potentials and subsequently finetuned on the quantum mechanical ground truth data. By evaluating across three diverse material systems (phosphorus, silica, and a subset of Materials Project) and three representative MLIP architectures (CGCNN, M3GNet, and TorchMD-NET), we find that this physics-informed pretraining consistently improves both prediction accuracy as well as stability in MD compared to the baselines."}

This effect enables generating unconventional out-of-plane orbital current with collinear orbital polarization from all 10 spin Laue groups of centrosymmetric altermagnets, which is critical for field-free manipulation of perpendicular magnetization that is a key for next-generation information technology. We reveal perturbative and non-perturbative effects of spin-group symmetry breaking, and unveil that MOT is a much more generic effect of real altermagnets than SST.

While polarization-resolved Raman scattering has been widely used to extract symmetry information of eigenmodes, its conventional geometry suffers from significant limitations: it accesses only a subset of Raman tensor elements, enforces π-periodic intensity patterns that obscure intrinsic crystalline symmetries, and lacks sensitivity to wavevector-dependent anisotropy. To overcome these constraints, here we introduce rotational-anisotropy Raman spectroscopy (RA-Raman). By measuring scattering intensity during full azimuthal rotation of the optical scattering plane at oblique incidence, this geometry enables complete reconstruction of the Raman tensor and reveals rich rotational anisotropy patterns essential for accessing subtle symmetry information elusive to conventional methods. We developed a prototype instrument to validate this approach experimentally. For centrosymmetric crystals, RA-Raman unambiguously identifies phonon symmetry representations and determines crystallographic axes. In noncentrosymmetric crystals, it resolves directional anisotropy and angular dispersion of phonon-polaritons, enabling quantitative determination of the Faust-Henry coefficient and the separation of deformation-potential and electro-optic scattering contributions. By demonstrating unprecedented symmetry-resolving power in standard benchmark crystals, we establish RA-Raman as a powerful tool with far-reaching potential to discover and characterize symmetry-breaking phases and topological excitations in quantum materials."}

These defect-based color centers are of particular interest for detection and response to physical variations such as pressure and strain.

The strain variations of the emission spectrum can be explained by differing responses of bulk-like and quasi-localized vibrational modes.

While much literature exists detailing corrosion rates and mechanisms of structural materials in liquid metals, much still remains to be discovered in new regimes of temperature, chemistry, and impurity levels. We focus on a less-studied set of conditions, specifically to investigate how liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) corrodes ferritic/martensitic steels in high-temperature oxidizing conditions. We find that corrosion follows grain boundaries, transitioning from intergranular attack to broader area corrosion as it progresses. Both the Cr and oxygen diffusion play vital roles in this process. Mechanistically speaking, the ingress of LBE induces regions of martensitic decomposition to ferrite via localized Cr depletion, somewhat blunting or slowing the corrosion from occurring. A stable, coherent oxide scale appears to be the deciding factor controlling whether intergranular LBE attack occurs or not. Most surprisingly, a layer of Fe enriched BCC phase forms on the surface of LBE-corroded T91 at these conditions, contradicting previous studies, including our own, which reported oxide-based surface layers."}

In centrosymmetric two-dimensional antiferromagnets, spin-polarized transport is symmetry-forbidden due to the combined space-time inversion ($PT$) symmetry. Here, by employing first-principles density functional theory and spin-group symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twisting two antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic monolayers of CoCl$_2$, AX$_2$ (A = Mn, V; X = Cl, Br, I), NiF$_2$, NiBr$_2$, FeS, CoS, MnTe$_2$, MnSe$_2$, and RuSe induces finite NRSS even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The relative twist breaks $[C_2||P]$ and $[E||C_{nz}]$ symmetries, giving rise to momentum-dependent spin polarization with distinct $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave altermagnetic patterns across the Brillouin zone. Using symmetry-invariant $k\\cdot p$ modeling, we extract linear spin-splitting coefficients $α^{(1)}$ ranging from 800-1100 meVÅ, comparable to SOC-induced Rashba-Dresselhaus strengths observed in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors. An out-of-plane electric field ($\\mathcal{E}_z$) introduces Zeeman-type band splitting up to 110 meV at 10 MV/cm, while biaxial strain tunes the NRSS magnitude nearly linearly without altering symmetry. Crucially, the strain $u_{xx-yy}$ reduces the spin point group symmetry and drives reversible $g/i \\rightarrow d$ wave-type transitions, resulting in finite spin conductivity and an enhanced spin-splitter angle (up to 18$^\\circ$). These results extend the concept of altermagnetism to twisted bilayer geometries and establish a general route for realizing exchange-driven, nonrelativistic spin currents through symmetry engineering without requiring heavy elements or spin-orbit coupling."}

Upon intercalation of 1ML of Co, the Co lattice is resized to match the Ir-Ir lattice parameter, resulting in a mismatched G/Co/Ir(111) system. The intercalation of further Co layers leads to a relaxation of the Co lattice and a progressive formation of a commensurate G layer lying on top. We show the C 1s line shape and the band structure of G in the two artificial phases, mismatched and commensurate G/Co, through a comparison with the electronic structure of G grown directly on a Co thick film. Our results show that while the G valence band mainly reflects the hybridization with the d states of Co, regardless of the structural phase, the C 1s line shape is very sensitive to the rumpling of the G layer and the coordination of carbon atoms with the underlying Co. Even in the commensurate (1x1) G/Co phase, where graphene is in register with the Co film, from the angular dependence of the C 1s core level we infer the presence of a double component, due to in-equivalent adsorption sites of carbon sub-lattices."}

The interplay between exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy stabilizes long-range ordering of such moments. The compound CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) presents an interesting class of vdW solids where the coupling of Cr3+ moments and ordering of Cu1+ ions give rise to a multiferroic ground state. Here we investigate the spin dynamics of Cr3+ ions in CCPS through magnetization and broadband as well as single sub-THz magnetic resonance measurements. The orbital moment of Cr3+ is quenched under the octahedral crystal field of surrounding chalcogen ions, resulting in negligible magnetic anisotropy-a feature common to Cr-based vdW antiferromagnets (AFM). Resonance spectra over a wide frequency-field-temperature range reveal quasi-2D AFM dynamics governed mainly by isotropic Cr-Cr exchange interactions, which determine the magnetic order, spin reorientation, and damping. Sub-THz resonance spectra also uncover a field-induced ferromagnetic polarization, highlighting the universal role of Cr-Cr exchange in layered Cr compounds. Moreover, persistent magnetic correlations far above the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) points to short-range magnetic order in CCPS and motivates future studies of a possible interplay between AFM and antiferroelectric orders. These results establish CCPS as an exemplary system for exploring 2D magnetism and electric-field-tunable spintronic functionalities in layered multiferroics."}

To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $γ$ and $δ$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites."}

Here, we use KTaO3 (KTO), a perovskite oxide that is newly discovered with room-temperature bulk plasticity, and demonstrate that the seeded dislocations can effectively tune both mechanical and functional properties. We uncover a novel brittle-ductile-brittle (BDB) transition: low dislocation densities lead to brittle failure, intermediate densities (~10*14 m-2) enable superior ductility with strains over 20%, and high dislocation densities (~10*15 m-2) induce again brittle fracture. This dislocation density-dependent non-monotonic mechanical response challenges the traditional behavior of ceramics and offers new design opportunities. Furthermore, dislocation densities can monotonically decrease thermal conductivity, revealing a tradeoff between mechanical strength and functionality. The findings reveal a critical threshold of dislocation density in optimizing the performance of functional oxides, and provide a new framework for using dislocations to design advanced materials where mechanical durability and enhanced functionality are intertwined."}

However, its influence on lattice thermal conductivity (kL) remains poorly understood. In the archetypal perovskite SrTiO3, tilting in the low-temperature tetragonal phase is known to enhance kL by suppressing specific phonon scattering channels around 200 cm-1. Here, we investigate the thermal transport in strontium stannate (SrSnO3), another perovskite oxide that undergoes temperature-driven phase transitions, and reveal a completely opposite effect. Through a systematic study across its orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, we demonstrate that octahedral tilting in the tetragonal phase of SrSnO3 anomalously triggers acoustic phonon softening. This softening manifests as reduced frequencies and group velocities in low-frequency (<3 THz) acoustic modes, creating a large decrease for heat transport, particularly along the c-axis. Consequently, kL is significantly suppressed, decreasing from 7.48 W m-1 K-1 to 6.06 W m-1 K-1 as the tilting angle increases by a mere 1 degree. These findings identify tilting-induced acoustic softening as a pivotal mechanism for limiting and controlling anisotropic thermal transport in SrSnO3, presenting a stark contrast to the established behavior in SrTiO3."}

While gauge-invariant quantities can be evaluated from overlap matrices between neighboring $k$ points, accessing the Berry connection itself as a smooth field requires specifying a continuous gauge over the Brillouin zone. Wannier-based workflows achieve this through projection onto localized orbitals, enabling stable evaluation of geometric quantities and response functions. In this setting, the Berry connection enters directly in Wannier-interpolated calculations of polarization, Berry curvature, optical conductivity, and related response functions. In practical implementations, however, the projection-gauge Berry connection is typically constructed from finite-difference overlaps between neighboring $k$ points, discretizing momentum derivatives and introducing errors tied to $k$-mesh spacing and gauge alignment. These effects can become numerically delicate in systems with small band gaps or when evaluating higher-order responses such as the Chern-Simons axion angle. Here, we derive an exact expression for the non-Abelian Berry connection in the projection gauge that is local in crystal momentum. Starting from projected and orthonormalized Bloch-like states, we obtain a closed-form equation expressed entirely in terms of $k$-local quantities. We validate the formulation in one and three dimensions by computing the Berry phase and Chern-Simons axion angle in tight-binding models. The resulting framework provides a stable route to evaluating geometric properties within Wannier interpolation schemes and future first-principles implementations."}

In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes. We further demonstrate transferability to interacting DMFT calculations for $\\mathrm{Sr_{2}RuO_{4}}$ solved with an adaptive-truncation impurity solver, where the ML initialization yields consistently faster convergence than a symmetry-preserving heuristic baseline while preserving the final fitted solution."}

While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation."}

Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents."}
