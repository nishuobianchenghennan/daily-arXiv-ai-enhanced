Such an interaction can be radiatively generated if dark matter couples to heavier charged particles. Previous studies have focused on the case where these charged states are much heavier than the reheat temperature, such that freeze-in production of dark matter is sensitive to the ultraviolet details of reheating. Here, we instead consider the possibility that these heavy states have masses comparable to the dark matter mass and are charged under a new kinetically-mixed $U(1)'$. As a result, dark matter production is dominated by the infrared freeze-in of the heavy charged states that subsequently thermalize the rest of the dark sector to a temperature much below that of the visible bath. We delineate regions of parameter space consistent with cosmological and astrophysical constraints and identify benchmark scenarios that can guide the next generation of direct detection experiments searching for spin-dependent scattering of sub-GeV dark matter."}

Submitted to Physica C: Superconductivity and its Applications (2025)", "summary": "In contrast to the extensive literature on thin tunnel junctions and traditional SQUID geometries, there is almost no quantitative experimental data on magnetic control of the Josephson phase in thick SNS weak links. The standard view is that in such compact structures without macroscopic loops the local magnetic coupling to the phase is negligibly small, which in practice forces one to use bulky SQUID devices for phase control. We show that this view is overly restrictive. We consider a thick SNS bridge with an on-chip microcoil placed directly above it, which controls the Josephson phase via strong phase-flux coupling enhanced near the Josephson plasma resonance. In the proposed configuration realistic thick SNS weak links, with normal-layer thickness d of order xi, can achieve phase-flux efficiencies of order 30-60 percent of an ideal dc SQUID. Within a standard RSJ/RCSJ model and linear circuit theory we show that this unexpectedly strong coupling arises from the combination of a large kinetic inductance of the thick SNS bridge and resonant amplification of about 15-35 dB, rather than from any exotic microphysics. The proposed experiment, a comparative analysis of Shapiro steps driven by a direct RF signal and by the magnetic field of the same microcoil, provides a direct and quantitative method to measure the phase-flux response of a thick SNS junction. If confirmed experimentally, such structures may become compact phase elements capable of locally controlling the Josephson phase without a macroscopic loop and enabling dense, locally addressable phase control in superconducting quantum circuits."}

However, the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is of particular interest in the fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential application in spintronics, is scarcely achieved due to restriction of inborn symmetry in crystals. Here, by tuning the direction and strength of magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, we report the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode by the magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations. Specifically, under a magnetic field with broken mirror symmetry, anomalous Hall effect with step feature results from the large Berry curvature for the gapped Weyl mode. A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively.

The high CISS-MR is attributed to interfacial spin-selective tunneling barrier induced by the chirality, which can produce current dissymmetry factors that surpass the limit imposed by the Jullière model governed by the intrinsic spin polarization of the adjacent FM contact. The CISS-MR exhibits a strong dependence on the CMHS composition, revealing a structure-property relationship between CISS and structural chirality. The observed exceptionally large tunneling MR response differentiates from a subtle anisotropic MR arising from the proximity effect at the FM/CMHS interface in the absence of a tunneling barrier.

By analyzing some experiments and performing calculations, we provide a full interpretation of their properties; from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metallic compounds. The variation of the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_{\\rm H}(T)$) with temperature at half-filling ($n = 1$) and, combinations of undoped ($p = 0$) insulators and metallic films, which, among other things, are indicative of a thermodynamic transition. On the overdoped side, recent experiments near the superconducting-to-metal transition detecting superconducting puddles and a considerable degree of charge disorder, suggest that a similar thermodynamic transition operates at all doping levels. We propose a spinodal or charge-separation transition starting near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$, which among other things generates the CDW domains with a typical double-well Landau free-energy functional. Thus, from the half-filled to the overdoped region, the free energy forms an array of wells with $n = 1$ {\\it static} holes. With doping, {\\it mobile} holes tend to occupy these wells with alternating high and low densities, generating the CDW pattern. The confined holes in small regions develop local superconducting amplitudes, giving rise to a mesoscopic granular superconductor. Similar to the XY model, the grains develop correlation effects mediated by Josephson coupling, which is proportional to the local superfluid density. This approach yields a unified theory of cuprate superconductors."}

Distributions of maximum principal stress () at the surface crack tip and along the upper half of the crack bottom are evaluated using steady-state thermal loading and a linear-elastic constitutive model. Across all cases, pronounced tensile stress concentration occurs at both locations: the maximum ranges from 19.2 to 34.1 MPa at the crack surface end and from 17.2 to 29.4 MPa at the crack bottom. These concentrated values are consistently higher than the stress level at the same locations in an otherwise identical uncracked wall, clarifying how seasonal temperature gradients under restraint amplify local stresses around existing defects. The quantitative ranges reported here provide a basis for risk screening and for formulating practical mitigation measures (e.g., joint spacing and insulation strategies) in the design and operation of urban underground enclosure walls. In addition, three-dimensional simulations of randomly distributed internal voids show that adopting average forming temperature increases the peak tensile stress on void surfaces from 3.42 to 4.40 MPa at 10 deg C and from 5.98 to 6.96 MPa at -5 deg C, further highlighting the risk amplification effect of AFT under cold service conditions."}

However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations. To overcome these challenges, this work develops matrix-free algorithms for FE-discretised DFT that substantially accelerate these products by doing on-the-fly operations that utilize structured tensor contractions over 1D basis functions and quadrature data. A unified multilevel batched data layout that handles both real and complex-valued operators is introduced to maximise cache reuse and SIMD utilisation on Frontier (AVX2), Param Pravega (AVX512) and Fugaku (SVE). We also combine terms for optimal cache reuse, even-odd decomposition to reduce FLOP, and mixed-precision intrinsics. Extensive benchmarks show that for large multivector pseudopotential DFT calculations, the matrix-free kernels deliver 1.5-4x speedups over the state-of-the-art cell-matrix approach baselines. For all-electron DFT calculations, the matrix-free operator achieves gains of up to 5.8x due to its efficient implementation and superior arithmetic intensity. When integrated with an error-tolerant Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration eigensolver, the matrix-free formalism yields substantial reductions in end-to-end time-to-solution using FE meshes that deliver desired accuracies in ground-state properties."}

According to available $v_2(p_t)$ data the assumption of a single dominant particle source within A-A collisions is unjustified. Combined with a previous study of quadrupole amplitude variation for 200 GeV $p$-$p$ collisions these results demonstrate that quadrupole structure is related to a novel QCD process separate from projectile-nucleon dissociation and jet production. Given quadrupole evolution it is unlikely that a hydrodynamic description is relevant to that process."}

This is possible because the tunneling current under the tip is an extremely localized electrical excitation source. However, in most STML applications, the spatial distribution of the emission relative to the excitation point is unresolved. Yet this distribution contains key information about how the interaction of excitons with injected charge carriers affects the luminescence of these materials, and about exciton transport. Resolving this spatial distribution at the nanoscale is relevant both for a fundamental understanding of exciton physics and for device applications; yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, we resolve the spatial distribution of the emission beyond the diffraction limit of light by deconvolving real-space optical microscopy images of the STML using an iterative algorithm, i.e., Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. To showcase this technique, we apply it to the STML of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\\mathrm{WSe_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\\mathrm{WS_2}$). Thus, we highlight hitherto ignored or misunderstood aspects of STML on 2D semiconductors related to exciton and charge carrier transport, namely the dependence of the spatial distribution of emission on the tunnel current setpoint and the origin of the emission from hot spots located micrometers from the excitation source."}

A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $λ$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors."}

Here we demonstrate the first fully automated experimental realization of Bayesian co-navigation - a framework in which an autonomous agent simultaneously runs a physical experiment and a computationally expensive physical model. Using an automated AFM platform coupled to a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model of thin-film growth, the system infers a set of effective bond energies for the (CrTaWV)x-Mo(1-x) pseudo-binary combinatorial library, progressively adjusting the kMC parameters to decrease the epistemic disparity between simulation and experiment. This real-time theoretical refinement enables the kMC model to capture the behavior of the specific materials system and reveals the mechanistic role of hetero-bonding in governing surface diffusion. Together, these results establish co-navigation as a general strategy for tightly integrating physical models with autonomous experimental platforms to produce interpretable and continually self-correcting theoretical modelling of complex materials systems."}

This article presents a self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations for analysing superconductivity in hydrides, contrasting with the commonly used McMillan-Allen-Dynes parameterized formula. We also analyse effects of the electron-phonon spectral function and the broadening parameters arising from phonon lifetime and sample imperfections on the superconducting critical temperature. Finally, both theoretical approaches are applied to a typical metal hydride superconductor, and the reliability of self-consistent solutions is validated against the experimentally measured critical temperature."}

Here we present a study of transcorrelated (TC) many-body wave-function methods on properties of solid state systems. We augment the existing xTC theory to periodic systems, and establish an unified transcorrelated embedding framework that integrates periodic TC theory with fragment-based correlated solvers. Using silicon as a test case, we validate the method against coupled-cluster, FCIQMC, and diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks for bulk. Then we apply TC embedding to calculation of formation energies of two silicon self-interstitials. The TC Hamiltonian yields rapid basis convergence and quantitatively reliable defect formation energies at the triple-$ζ$ level, substantially reducing the basis-set bottleneck for wave-function treatments of crystalline defects."}

In this work, we extend KoMPoST to include non-boost-invariant responses to initial conditions, essential for accurately capturing the longitudinal structures observed in heavy-ion collisions. Non-boost-invariant fluctuations on top of a homogeneous background are evolved using (3+1)D response functions calculated in kinetic theory. To assess kinetic theory's transition towards hydrodynamic evolution, we systematically compare the out-of-equilibrium shear-stress tensor from KoMPoST-3D with estimates based on Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. Subsequently, a comprehensive (3+1)D framework, McDIPPER+KoMPoST-3D+CLVisc+SMASH, is utilized to simulate the complete spacetime evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of key observables, including longitudinal structure of anisotropic flow, to variations in the hydrodynamic initialization time is thoroughly investigated."}

Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals.

Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade).

It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments.

The framework has since been extended to include the next-to-leading Fock sector $|qqqg\\rangle$, enabling studies of gluonic contributions to the nucleon's internal structure, including gluon helicity, orbital angular momentum, and three-dimensional imaging through generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GPDs and TMDs). Most recently, BLFQ has achieved a significant milestone by computing nucleon light-front wavefunctions as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian without an explicit confining potential. These calculations, including Fock sectors up to $|qqqq\\bar{q}\\rangle$, further develop the path to first-principles predictions of quark and gluon matter densities, helicity and transversity distributions, and spin observables, showing qualitative agreement with experimental and phenomenological results.

Thermal fluctuations are taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent functional-integral theory. It is established that when the nodal points are located far inside (outside) the Fermi contour of the normal phase, thermal fluctuations expand the relative temperature ranges in which the values of the topological index are close to integer values C1=4(-2). This expansion depends both on the value of the topological index and on the magnitude of the effective attraction between the electrons. However, as the nodal points approach the Fermi contour, topological crossovers to new C1 values are observed, which can persist over a wide temperature range. The nature and degree of influence of thermal fluctuations on these crossovers are established. It is assumed that the observed effects may also manifest in the edge state behavior of a similar system with open boundaries."}

By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations.

A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $λ$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors."}

Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\\bar z$ scaling as $\\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent.

Transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy captures sub-picosecond electron localization within VO$_4$ tetrahedra, consistent with small polaron formation, whereas time-resolved X-ray diffraction reveals a slower, multi-picosecond lattice reorganization into a hidden photoexcited state that is structurally distinct from both the monoclinic ground state and the high-temperature tetragonal phase.

Suppressed by the small mixing angle $θ$ between the dark fermions, the small effective gauge coupling of dark matter $χ_1$ to the gauge boson $Z'$ is one distinct feature of this model, rendering phenomenology in many aspects more promising. In this paper, we investigate the production of dark matter through new mechanisms within the frameworks of resonance and secluded scenarios. The impacts of phenomenological constraints from collider, dark matter, and cosmology are also taken into account. We report that the conversion mechanism is both favored by the resonance and secluded scenarios under current constraints."}

Its coherent generation and detection remain, however, largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generate sizable orbital currents in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers through both the acoustic orbital Hall effect and acoustic orbital pumping. Using symmetry analysis of SAW-driven voltages, we disentangle vorticity-sensitive orbital currents arising from lattice rotation in the non-magnetic layer from angular-momentum pumping from the ferromagnet. Strong signals are observed only in nickel/chromium and nickel/titanium, while nickel/aluminum and all cobalt-based bilayers show negligible responses, revealing the critical roles of orbital Hall conductivity, phonon-orbital coupling, and interfacial orbital transparency. Comparison with spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and second-harmonic measurements -- where electrically driven orbital angular momentum are weaker -- demonstrates that phonon excitation generates orbital currents more efficiently. These results establish chiral SAWs as an effective route for orbitronic functionality and open pathways toward phonon-controlled orbital magnetism."}

In superluminal scenarios, neutrinos can decay through vacuum $e^-e^+$ pair emission or neutrino splitting. Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds. The survival-probability approximation adopted in previous works is therefore justified, while our framework provides a coherent basis for future analyses of superluminal neutrino constraints, which should consistently include possible time-delay signatures."}

However, their aggregation and poor conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to improve the conductivity and density of electroactive edges of MoS2 through hybridization with akin advanced 2D materials. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are added to a liquid-phase-exfoliated MoS2 dispersion to create drop-casting hybrid MoS2@rGO electrodes for HER. The findings reveal the formation of ~1.1 nm-thick MoS2 bilayers, with the catalytic performance of MoS2@rGO dependent on the degree of graphene oxide reduction. The rGO moderate reduction prevents the MoS2 bilayers from restacking, improves conductivity, retains oxygenated groups that enhance interlayer spacing, and exposes more electroactive edges. When hybridized with rGO crafted at optimal reduction time, the hybrid system eclipses the efficiency of pristine MoS2 bilayers by attaining the lowest overpotential (~70 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (~46 mV dec-1). This shows that MoS2 bilayers hybridized with rGO offer a promising method to outperform the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2-based electrodes. These findings expand opportunities for future strain engineering, defect engineering, and high-end twist-angle assemblies for hybrid systems combining MoS2 bilayers and rGO."}

Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity.

In order to rationalize and control this growth, a model is derived that revisits the dewetting thermodynamics and considers generally ignored adsorption and step-edge energies.

Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4πe/27\\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed."}

The simulations employ a rate-dependent crystal plasticity constitutive model that incorporates both slip and twinning deformation mechanisms. The model accounts for the spatially non-uniform appearance of new twin-related orientations, hardening due to slip--twin interactions, and modified properties of the twinned crystal. Limited experiments on single-crystal dog-bone and single-edge notch specimens, with two crystal orientations, are also conducted to aid the simulation. Several features of the experimental observations are accurately captured in the simulations. For example, simulations accurately capture distinct stress--strain responses associated with different crystallographic orientations, including variations in initial hardening behavior followed by either decreasing or increasing hardening depending on the dominant deformation mechanisms. The simulation also captures the observed orientation-dependent asymmetric deformation of the notch in single-edge notch specimens. Additionally, by selectively activating deformation mechanisms, the role of twinning is isolated and its influence on both global and local response is clearly demonstrated. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how deformation mode interactions and local geometry (i.e., notch) influence the response of these materials."}

This rather unique `Exotic Invariant' is suggested by the detailed form of the SSM, combined with the detailed form of the BRS cohomology of SUSY.\n  The motivation for examining the XM is that the usual SSM has some well-known, and serious, problems in its generally accepted, but unsatisfactory, SUSY breaking mechanism. That mechanism is based on the spontaneous breaking of SUSY.\n  The Exotic Model avoids all of these problems, easily, because its SUSY splitting mechanism does not use, or need, any kind of spontaneous breaking of SUSY. The XM contains a mechanism for SUSY mass splitting because the addition of the Exotic Invariant modifies the algebra of SUSY. This paper is E8 in a series of papers denoted En, n= 1,2, ... all devoted to the XM. There is a lot of work still required to elucidate how the XM functions, and to see if the XM is really a viable alternative to the SSM. The first crucial question, raised in E7, is whether it is possible to constrain the initial XM action, so that the result excludes tachyonic excitations at tree level. If the XM is to be a viable theory, it is essential to first remove the tachyonic excitations, in a sensible way, from the fermionic and the bosonic sectors of the quadratic ZX action.\n  This paper E8 explains how to remove the tachyons from the basic fermionic `ZX sector' at tree level. There are four fermion fields in this ZX sector. The removal requires that all of these fields have the same mass. This result is shown using a Mathematica notebook, which is issued with this paper."}

This is immediately followed by the overgrowth of CsPbBr3, delivering AgBr@CsPbBr3 nanocubes of several tens of nanometers in size, with the volume of the AgBr core being only a small fraction of the overall nanocrystal volume. The formation of a core@shell geometry is facilitated by the epitaxial compatibility between AgBr and CsPbBr3 along multiple crystallographic directions. Exchange with Cl- ions leads to Ag@CsPbCl3 nanocubes, whereas exchange with I- ions leads to hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes, due to selective etching of the AgBr (or Ag) core region by the I- ions diffusing in the nanocubes. These hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes can then be converted into hollow CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 nanocubes by halide exchange. The optical emission properties of the hollow CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocubes are in line with those expected from large, non-hollow halide perovskite nanocrystals, indicating that the small hollow region in the cubes has no major influence on their optical properties."}

In our synthesis scheme of CsPbBr3 NCs we replaced excess Pb2+ with different exogenous metal cations (M) and investigated their effect on the synthesis products. These cations can be divided into two groups: group 1 delivers monodisperse CsPbBr3 cubes capped with oleate species (as for the case when Pb2+ is used in excess) and with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 90% with some cations (for example with M= In3+); group 2 yields irregularly shaped CsPbBr3 NCs with broad size distributions. In both cases, the addition of a tertiary ammonium cation (didodecylmethyl ammonium, DDMA+) during the synthesis, after the nucleation of the NCs, reshapes the NCs to monodisperse truncated cubes. Such NCs feature a mixed oleate/DDMA+ surface termination with PLQY values up to 90%. For group 1 cations, this happens only if the ammonium cation is directly added as a salt (DDMA-Br) while for group 2 cations this happens even if the corresponding tertiary amine (DDMA) is added, instead of DDMA-Br. This is attributed to the fact that only group 2 cations can facilitate the protonation of DDMA by the excess oleic acid present in the reaction environment. In all cases studied, the incorporation of M cations is marginal and the reshaping of the NCs is only transient: if the reactions are run for a long time the truncated cubes evolve to cubes."}

Solving the relic abundance with a two-temperature Boltzmann evolution including plasmon decays, we find that $ε, g_D \\sim 10^{-7}$ reproduce the observed density while satisfying astrophysical and cosmological bounds.

Focusing on four-lepton final states at multi-TeV lepton colliders, we conduct a detailed analysis of cross sections, asymmetries, and polarization effects. We show that the signal cross section is highly sensitive to $m_{Z^\\prime}$ and the effective parameters $\\tilde{g}/m_{Z^\\prime}$, while remaining largely insensitive to the triplet Yukawa couplings within the phenomenologically allowed region. The forward-backward asymmetry exhibits a characteristic monotonic dependence on $m_{Z^\\prime}$, and beam polarization can significantly suppress Standard Model backgrounds while enhancing new physics contributions. We find that over the phenomenologically allowed parameter space, the predicted observables remain highly sensitive to the underlying model parameters. These results demonstrate that multi-lepton final states are powerful probes of the $U(1)_{Lμ- L_τ}$ framework and offer valuable guidance for future searches at muon and electron-positron colliders."}

Our approach incorporates explicit ab initio light-matter coupling and first-principles collision integrals for carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering. It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments. The method can be coupled to constrained density-functional theory to access light-induced structural phase transitions at longer times after the light pulse. We showcase the capabilities and predictive power of this framework on MoS$_2$ and h-BN monolayers. For MoS$_2$, we resolve photoinduced renormalizations of electronic and lattice properties, ultrafast carrier relaxation, hot-phonon dynamics, and displacive coherent atomic motion. Including carrier-carrier scattering is crucial to obtain realistic photocarrier equilibration times, while omitting phonon-phonon scattering leads to incorrect long-time lattice thermalization and a factor of two larger A$_{1g}$ coherent phonon damping time. For h-BN, we quantify photoinduced changes in the electronic, optical, and lattice responses in quasi-equilibrium, demonstrating a fluence-dependent enhancement of screening and melting of excitonic features."}

Within the constituent quark model framework, we calculate their mass spectra in the range of 4.7-5.4 GeV and corresponding internal mass contributions via the Gaussian expansion method. The root-mean-square radii, typically between 1.1-1.6 fm, indicate compact spatial structures. Furthermore, we also calculate the rearrangement decay widths via the quark-interchange model, finding that all states are unstable and decay into a singly-charmed baryon and a singly-charmed meson. Several narrow resonances have been identified, some of which have a total width even below 10 MeV. We hope that our study could provide valuable guidance for future theoretical investigations and experimental searches targeting doubly-charmed pentaquarks."}

In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive temperature-dependent Raman spectrum for bulk Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ and in the process reveal an interesting peak shift anomaly at 150 K. We discuss the possible relationship of this Raman anomaly with the anomalous lattice expansion reported earlier for this material at around 110 K. The impact of the anomalous lattice expansion on the magnetic anisotropy in this van der Waals material is also revealed by an isothermal magnetization analysis. These findings will prove crucial for the use of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ in high-performance spintronic devices."}

An example is an estimate of the $J/ψ~p$ scattering length $|α_{J/ψ~p}|$ on the bound proton obtained using the Vector Meson Dominance model. This value can be compared with that of the free proton from the GlueX Collaboration. One may then project what would be expected from the SRC/CT Collaboration Experiment E12--25--002, which was recently approved by the JLab PAC. Using a plane-wave theoretical model to generate quasi-data, we find the experiment could achieve a result of $|α_{J/ψ~p}| = 3.08\\pm 0.45~\\mathrm{mfm}$, an uncertainty competitive with that of the free-proton measurement.

A critical issue may arise in interaction between $XHe$ and atomic nuclei due to the unshielded nuclear attraction, which could destabilize the dark atom's bound state. To resolve this, we propose a novel numerical quantum mechanical approach that accounts for self-consistent electromagnetic-nuclear couplings. This method addresses to eliminate the inherent complexity of the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, where analytical solutions are intractable. By reconstructing the effective interaction potential - including dipole Coulomb barrier and shallow potential well - we demonstrate how these features lead to the formation of $XHe$-nucleus bound states and modulate low-energy capture processes. Our model enables validation of the dark atom hypothesis, particularly in interpreting experimental anomalies like annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA. These findings advance the theoretical foundation for dark matter interactions and provide a robust framework for future experimental design."}

Here, we employ the experimentally realized AgBiI$_4$ double salt as a structural prototype and replace Bi$^{3+}$ with In$^{3+}$ to design a novel lead-free halide compound, AgInI$_4$. First-principles calculations predict that AgInI$_4$ is both chemically and dynamically stable, exhibiting a direct band gap of 1.72 eV, comparable to its bismuth analogue. However, its predicted photovoltaic performance, evaluated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency metric, is lower under both solar and LED illumination. This reduction arises primarily from symmetry-forbidden optical transitions and the absence of Bi-derived 6s$^2$ lone-pair states at the valence band maximum. High-throughput screening of the Ag-In-I ternary phase-space reveals several more stable and metastable compounds that fall into two structural families: tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated, with characteristic band gaps near 3.0 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Despite multiple synthetic attempts, the predicted AgInI$_4$ phase could not be experimentally realized, underscoring the challenges of stabilizing indium-based halide double salts. While these materials are unlikely to serve as efficient photovoltaic absorbers, their tunable band gaps and stability make them promising candidates for charge transport and other optoelectronic applications."}

They point to the possibility of the presence of a new Higgs particle in the spectrum, in addition to the already observed 125 GeV state. In particular, there are excesses involving a diphoton resonance at invariant masses of about 95 GeV, 152 GeV and 650 GeV and an extra scalar might accompany the recent observation of a toponium at a mass of about 350 GeV. Several interpretations of these excesses have been attempted in extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, we aim to explain them in the framework of a two Higgs doublet model supplemented by a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs boson $a$ which would correspond to the putative resonance in most cases. This realistic 2HD+a scenario is attractive as it is has the virtue to pass all experimental constraints from high-precision experiments and collider searches and, at the same time, to allow for a viable explanation of the dark matter in the universe. We first update the present constraints on the model, in particular taking into account the latest results on dark matter and Higgs searches, as well the high-precision measurements, including those from Higgs and flavor physics. We then show that the additional Higgs states with the proper mass spectrum and adjusted couplings to fermions, would explain all the LHC excesses (but individually) while passing the former experimental constraints as well as the theoretical ones."}

However, their aggregation and poor conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to improve the conductivity and density of electroactive edges of MoS2 through hybridization with akin advanced 2D materials. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are added to a liquid-phase-exfoliated MoS2 dispersion to create drop-casting hybrid MoS2@rGO electrodes for HER. The findings reveal the formation of ~1.1 nm-thick MoS2 bilayers, with the catalytic performance of MoS2@rGO dependent on the degree of graphene oxide reduction. The rGO moderate reduction prevents the MoS2 bilayers from restacking, improves conductivity, retains oxygenated groups that enhance interlayer spacing, and exposes more electroactive edges. When hybridized with rGO crafted at optimal reduction time, the hybrid system eclipses the efficiency of pristine MoS2 bilayers by attaining the lowest overpotential (~70 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (~46 mV dec-1). This shows that MoS2 bilayers hybridized with rGO offer a promising method to outperform the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2-based electrodes.

Using germanium as a critical test case, we challenge the ability of both functionals to capture semiconductor properties. Although HSE improves PBE's gap error, it fails to reproduce germanium's correct $Γ$-L indirect and $Γ$-$Γ$ band gaps simultaneously. Noting that the PBE underestimated energy separation between the 4p valence-band maximum and 4s conduction-band minimum causes unphysical $sp$ mixing, we propose DFT+$α$, a semi-empirical correction scheme applied selectively to 4s-like orbitals.

Using the latest nuclear-recoil data from XENONnT, which show indications of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8$B solar neutrinos, we derive new strong bounds on light mediator couplings. We find that these limits are significantly more stringent when the mediator couples to DM, rather than when new physics affects only neutrino interactions. Building on these results, we recompute the expected neutrino fog and compare it with the corresponding constraints on spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon interactions. We show that the morphology of the neutrino fog can be markedly modified if either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through light mediators, even in light of these recent constraints."}

Here, we report the fabrication of \\textit{non-alloyed} \\textit{as-deposited} ohmic contacts to 71\\% n+AlGaN ($E_\\text{g}\\sim5.4$~eV) with a free carrier concentration of roughly $7\\times 10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and a resistivity of 4 - 5.5 m$Ω$cm (among the lowest reported for Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N) with linear $I-V$ characteristics and a contact resistivity of $ρ_\\text{c}=(4.4\\pm1.0)\\times10^{-4}$~$Ω$cm$^2$ (measured at zero voltage). Contacts with this quality are formed by two separate fabrication schemes: (i) metal-first patterning, and (ii) lift-off with an oxygen asher descum prior to metal deposition. Given the low threading dislocation density in the single-crystal AlN substrate used for epitaxy, the smooth morphology of the contacted epitaxial surface, and the non-alloyed nature of the contacts, this contact resistivity is attributed purely to thermionic field emission through the metal-semiconductor junction. Contact resistivity extraction at low current injection enables us to model these results using a thermionic field-emission model of contact resistivity, yielding a barrier height for Ti/Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N of $(0.81\\pm0.02)$ eV."}

As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders."}

However, the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is of particular interest in the fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential application in spintronics, is scarcely achieved due to restriction of inborn symmetry in crystals. Here, by tuning the direction and strength of magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, we report the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode by the magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations. Specifically, under a magnetic field with broken mirror symmetry, anomalous Hall effect with step feature results from the large Berry curvature for the gapped Weyl mode. A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively. Our findings reveal distinct Weyl modes under the intertwined crystal symmetry and time-reversal breaking, laying the foundation of manipulating multiple Weyl modes in chiral spintronic network."}

Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, which average over the entire illuminated sample volume, SP-SAXS resolves low-contrast, less abundant, or transient species within heterogeneous particle populations that would otherwise remain hidden. Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes."}
