To date, the majority of the magnonic\nsystems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close\nproximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other\nexcitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in\ndeveloping remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the\ncontrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has\nbeen a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here,\nwe integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator\nconsisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and\ndemonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the\nopto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the\nhallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon\nmode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by\nan external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump\nphase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate\nauto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating\nlong-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which\nmay be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems."}

While numerous models exist which explain certain aspects\nof this phenomenon, a unified, physical model capable of explaining all details\nof pattern formation has remained elusive.

From the\ntime-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine\nmultipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin\ncorrelators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In\nparticular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in\nthe Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as\nalso discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to\nKitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson\nloop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory\neffects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also\nacquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian\ndynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening\navenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering."}

At the meta-GGA level, molecular phases (Cmca-4, Cmca-12, and C2/c)\nare stabilized over the atomic I41/amd phase up to significantly higher\npressures than predicted by GGA, in closer agreement with diffusion Monte Carlo\ncalculations and experimental observations of band-gap closure near 425 GPa.\nFurthermore, phonon spectra calculated with R2SCAN show that the dynamical\ninstabilities and anharmonic signatures previously predicted at the GGA level\nvanish, indicating that such effects may partly arise from functional\ndeficiencies rather than genuine nuclear quantum effects.

Application of external magnetic\nfields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered\nphases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak\ncoupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been\nproposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to\nfeature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the\nzero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific\nfamily of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite\nvalue in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis\n(arXiv:2501.18591).

In a two-dimensional electronic\nsystem, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons\ncondense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This\nordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic\nscale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and\nmoire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be\nformed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying\nvoltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole\ndensity by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For\ndensities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes\nindividual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By\nincreasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi\nliquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which\nindicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be\nformed within a narrow effective density range.

By applying\na vertical electric field, we reveal strong Coulomb interactions of dipolar\nhybrid excitons, leading to opposite density-dependent energy shifts of the two\nmain hybrid species based on their dipolar orientation, together with a\nstrongly enhanced optical saturation of their absorption. Furthermore, by\nelectrically tuning the interlayer tunneling between the hybridized carriers,\nwe significantly extend the formation time of hybrid excitons, while\nsimultaneously increasing their decay times.
