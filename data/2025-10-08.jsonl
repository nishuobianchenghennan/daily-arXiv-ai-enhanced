Simulation experiments using\nfour real-world datasets, including Delhivery Logistics and the SCMS Global\nHealth Delivery system, apply maximum likelihood estimation and grid search to\noptimize adoption intensity and order quantity. Across all datasets, the NB\nspecification outperforms Poisson and Gaussian benchmarks, with overdispersion\nindices exceeding 1.5.

While the\nproperties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general\ndescription of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature,\nwhich leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons.\nIn this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between\nWannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two\nground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This\npotential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the\nparticles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it\nbecomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two\ninteracting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a\ngeneralization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including\ncorrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large\ndistances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the\ninteractions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a\nmany-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that\nformally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field\nrepresenting the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal\nexchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the\ndiagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our\nvariational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay\nthe groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and\ntheir application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic\nmatter."}

While earlier investigations examined the\nprotonation of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5, the thermodynamics of protonation\nacross the perovskite-to-brownmillerite transition remain poorly understood. In\nthis work, we combine density functional theory calculations with predictions\nfrom universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to elucidate the\nenergetics and implications of protonation across the transition for\nLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\\delta$. These calculations reveal negative hydrogen insertion\nenergies and strong competition with oxygen vacancy formation across the\ntransition for a wide range of conditions. The extent of protonation is\nprimarily limited by the availability of Co 3d states to accommodate reduction\nby inserted hydrogen. Although hydrogen insertion is often thermodynamically\nfavorable within a defect picture, a convex hull analysis of the resulting\nHyLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\\delta$ phases reveals them to be unstable against\ndecomposition into hydroxides among other products.

We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in\ntwo orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance\nand thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to\nthe growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the\nsquare root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to\nthe growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an\napproximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not\nfrom differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer\ncorrelation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation\ncoefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond\ncrystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a\ntwo-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the\ndiamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By\noptimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match\nexperimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth\ndirection, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients.\nFurthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that\nretardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base\nretardances in both orientations.

While the\nproperties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general\ndescription of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature,\nwhich leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons.\nIn this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between\nWannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two\nground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This\npotential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the\nparticles.

This\npotential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the\nparticles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it\nbecomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two\ninteracting hydrogen atoms.

The new\napproach mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which has been\nso far performed using a single large GPU kernel, into several smaller kernels.\nI also take this opportunity to describe more in detail some features of the\nCUDACPP software that are relevant to these new developments and that have not\nyet been documented."}

Here, we investigate the transient optical response of\nthe intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 using polarization-resolved ultrafast\noptical spectroscopy. We identify a discontinuous sign reversal in the\ntransient reflectivity at Tc ~ 110 K, providing unambiguous evidence for the\nfirst-order transition. The anisotropic quasiparticle relaxation establishes\nthe three-dimensional nature of the ordered state. Below Tc, a single coherent\n1.6 THz oscillation appears abruptly and remains confined to the CDW phase.\nThis mode exhibits weak temperature dependence with negligible softening and is\nabsent in Raman spectra. First-principles calculations imply that it is a\nprecursor phonon at the CDW wave vector with strong electron-phonon coupling.\nOur results indicate that the CDW in BaFe2Al9 arises from intertwined\nelectronic and lattice instabilities, assisted by a displacive mechanism\nmediated by a hidden strongly coupled phonon, distinct from conventional\namplitude-mode softening scenarios."}

Recently synthesized\nCsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has provided a rare opportunity to explore unconventional\nsuperconductivity in a strongly correlated kagome system with hints of\nfrustrated magnetism and quantum criticality. Using spectroscopic imaging\nscanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal a cascade of density wave transitions\nwith different symmetries in bulk single crystals of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. In\nparticular, we discover a new electronic state $-$ a unidirectional density\nwave that breaks all mirror symmetries akin to a chiral density wave, but in\ncontrast retains a mirror-glide symmetry. We term this state a frieze\ncharge-stripe order phase, because its symmetry properties agree with one of\nthe fundamental frieze symmetry groups. A combination of high-resolution\nimaging, Fourier analysis and theoretical simulations uncovers the crucial role\nof sublattice degrees of freedom in forming this phase, with internal chiral\ntextures of opposite handedness. Our experiments reveal that superconductivity\nin CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ develops from a new type of a unidirectional density wave,\nand set the foundation for exploring electronic states with frieze symmetry\ngroups in quantum materials."}
