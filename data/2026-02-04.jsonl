The code numerically solves the Schrodinger evolution equation in the flavor basis using explicit construction and diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian within the PMNS formalism, including full CP Violating phase dependence. In contrast to large scale oscillation toolkits optimized for experimental simulations, NeutrinoOsc3Flavor is designed as a minimal dependency reference implementation, emphasizing analytical traceability, equation level accessibility, and cross platform portability. The framework relies solely on NumPy for numerical linear algebra and runs natively on both Linux and Windows systems without external compilation or specialized libraries. As an internal consistency and validation feature, we implement an independent analytical determination of the matter modified Hamiltonian eigenvalues using the Cardano method and demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical diagonalization. CP Phase dependence is used as a sensitive diagnostic of numerical stability and correctness of the evolution operator in both vacuum and matter. NeutrinoOsc3Flavor is intended as a verification oriented and pedagogical computational tool, suitable for theoretical cross-checks, educational use, and benchmarking of more complex neutrino oscillation software, rather than as a replacement for full experimental simulation frameworks. Here, we consider the DUNE experiments baseline length in the python implementation but in general we can implement any value of baseline length."}

Known as the flavor pendulum, this behavior appears among the collective modes of a dense neutrino plasma after a strong reduction of phase space through symmetry assumptions. It has been identified in homogeneous slow and fast flavor systems and, most recently, in single-wave solutions of the fast system. We explain the reasons for its ubiquitous appearance. We show that a system of three classical spins must always be pendular, or only two in the presence of an external field. Furthermore, such a system always defines a continuum of vectors with time-independent length. If these are identified as interacting spins, they immediately lead to the continuum cases of slow and fast flavor pendula. As another new insight, any of these spins can be chosen as the pendulum, periodically exchanging flavor with the rest of the system."}

The measured spectra are analyzed with the Tsallis non-extensive distribution, from which the effective temperature T, non-extensive parameter q, and the mean transverse momentum mean_pT are extracted for each particle species and centrality interval. To disentangle thermal and collective effects, the mean kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 is obtained from the intercept of the T-versus-mass relation, while the average transverse flow velocity betaT is extracted from the slope of mean_pT versus the mean moving mass for pions, kaons, and protons.\n  The results show that T increases and q decreases with increasing centrality, indicating a hotter and more equilibrated system in central collisions. A clear mass dependence of T supports a multi-freeze-out scenario, with heavier particles decoupling earlier. Both T0 and betaT rise from peripheral to mid-central collisions before saturating toward central events, which may suggest the onset of collective behavior or changes in freeze-out dynamics.

Moreover, $J(x)$ in a strip can be tuned by control wires to produce an inverted $J(x)$ profile with dips at the edges to mitigate current crowding at lithographic defects and block premature penetration of vortices. These conclusions are corroborated by calculations of $J(x)$ in a thin strip coupled inductively with side control wires or in bilayer strip structures by solving the London and Ginzburg Landau equations in the thin film Pearl limit. Thermally-activated penetration of vortices from the edges and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs in inverted $J(x)$ profiles are evaluated.

Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters.

Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analysis suggests that LiMgZr2H12 reaches a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 60.8 K at ambient pressure. Compared with MgZrH6, Li doping significantly increases the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the electron density of states near the Fermi level (EF) and enhances the EPC constant of the LiMgZr2H12 structure. LiMgZr2H12 exhibits a superconducting figure of merit of 1.56, which is significantly greater than that of MgZrH6, demonstrating its outstanding potential for practical applications.

We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations.

This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents. The resulting nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag provides a clear and unambiguous transport signature of phase-coherent exciton condensation, offering a powerful and experimentally accessible approach to identify, probe, and control exciton superfluidity in solid-state platforms."}

Prevailing theoretical frameworks have predominantly emphasized electronic degrees of freedom, largely neglecting the rich physics inherent in the lattice. Although conventional phonon theory offers an elegant description of structural phase diagrams and lattice dynamics, its omission of nuclear quantum many-body effects results in misleading phase diagram interpretations and, consequently, an unsound foundation for superconducting theory. Here, by incorporating nuclear quantum many-body effects within first-principles calculations, we discover a lattice quantum disordered phase in superconductors H3S and La3Ni2O7. This phase occupies a triangular region in the pressure-temperature phase diagram, whose left boundary aligns precisely with Tc of the left flank of the superconducting dome. The Tcmax of this quantum disordered phase coincides with the maximum of superconducting Tc, indicating this phase as both the origin of superconductivity on the dome's left flank and a key ingredient of its pairing mechanism. Our findings advance the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity and establish the lattice quantum disordered phase as a unifying framework, both for predicting new superconductors and for elucidating phenomena in a broader context of condensed matter physics."}

Then, using atomistic tight-binding and strain-extended continuum models to study the commensurate structures, we identify configurations that minimize the bandwidth beyond the magic angle. The results reveal a strong dependence of band narrowing and topology on strain type, magnitude, direction and lattice relaxation. Particularly, shear strain produces a stronger distortion than uniaxial strain. Including electron-electron interactions through a self-consistent Hartree potential shows that strain broadens the bare bands while reducing electrostatic renormalization. Strain also drives topological transitions as the narrow and remote bands hybridize, establishing twisted and strained bilayer graphene as a tunable platform for flat-band and topological phenomena."}

The method combines classical Jacobi-Richardson iterations with data-driven corrections to refine numerical solutions while preserving the underlying topological and metric structure. NHCS employs a two-phase training strategy. In the first phase, DEC operators are learned through relative residual minimization from data. In the second phase, these operators are integrated into the iterative solver, and training targets the improvement of convergence through learned corrective updates that remain effective even for inaccurate intermediate solutions. This staggered training enables stable, progressive refinement while maintaining the structure-preserving properties of DEC discretizations. To improve multiscale adaptivity, NHCS introduces a convolutional neural network-based correction term capable of capturing fine-scale solution features via localized updates informed by global context, improving scalability over mesh component-wise neural approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework substantially reduces computational cost by avoiding Newton-Raphson-based training and the associated Jacobian evaluations of parameterized operators.

In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies."}

To model the propagation of the phase boundaries in deformable magnetic materials at the continuum scale, three ingredients are required: a set of governing equations for the bulk behaviour with coupled magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom, a dependency of the phase boundary velocity on the governing factors, and a reliable computational method. The expression for the phase boundary velocity is usually obtained within the continuum thermodynamics setting, where the entropy production due to phase boundary propagation is derived, which gives a thermodynamic driving force for the phase boundary kinetics. For deformable ferromagnets, all three elements (bulk behaviour, interface kinetics, and computational approaches) have been explored, but under a number of limitations. The present paper focuses on the derivation of the thermodynamic driving force for transformation fronts in a general magneto-mechanical setting, adapts the cut-finite-element method for transformation fronts in magneto-mechanics, which allows for an exceptionally efficient handling of the propagating interfaces, without modifying the finite-element mesh, and applies the developments to qualitative modelling of magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys."}

Motivated by recent photocurrent measurements of vibronic sidebands in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ optoelectronic devices, we present a nonperturbative theoretical framework for phonon-assisted absorption in van der Waals heterostructures. Using a polaron transformation, a closed-form expression for the optical absorption spectrum at arbitrary temperatures is presented. Our model includes both intraband and interband electron--phonon coupling. Detailed analysis shows that the observed periodic sidebands originate from the strong coupling between interlayer excitons and nearly dispersionless optical phonon modes. Comparing two limiting cases - one involving only intraband couplings, and another incorporating coherent interband processes - we show that interband phonon-assisted transitions are needed to account for the observed data. Beyond enabling the direct estimation of vibronic coupling strengths from spectroscopic data, these findings have profound consequences for our understanding of optical and optoelectronic responses: coherent interband coupling of atomic vibrations to excitons is essential to quantifying photoresponse in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures."}

Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations. Our findings elucidate the intricate interplay among lattice, orbital, spin, and electronic degrees of freedom and reveal a feasible structural control parameter for the multi-orbital correlated state in trilayer nickelates, which provide a concrete framework for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure."}

Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $μ^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders.

As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments.

Signatures of strong correlations- such as the onset of atomic or atomic-ligand multiplets and spin-orbit-entangled exciton have been observed in this material by various two-particle spectroscopies, but not previously in photoemission. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive feature at the valence-band edge that is absent in DFT+$U$ calculations and remains unchanged across the Néel transition. After critically examining and ruling out alternative interpretations, we show that an exact diagonalization of a NiS$_6$ cluster yields low-energy final-state configurations of mixed multiplet $d^7$ and $d^8\\underline{L}$ character, whose energy differences are consistent with the observed additional feature. This implies that ARPES directly accesses local Ni-S multiplet physics in NiPS$_3$, revealing a many-body structure beyond mean-field theory. Our results confirm that NiPS$_3$ is an excellent model platform in which strong correlations, reduced dimensionality, and covalent metal-ligand bonding jointly shape both two- and single-particle spectroscopies, underscoring the need for a genuinely quantum many-body description of two-dimensional quantum materials."}

We integrate 2H-stacked MoSe$_{2}$/$^{1}$WSe$_{2}$/$^{2}$WSe$_{2}$ heterotrilayer onto a chirped distributed Bragg reflector that acts as a backside mirror. This way, we fabricate a platform that hosts distinct heterotrilayer, heterobilayer, and homobilayer regions with enhanced excitonic features at elevated temperatures. Although the heterobilayer supports temperature-tunable singlet and triplet interlayer excitons, it exhibits low emission yield at 4 K. In comparison, the heterotrilayer shows remarkable excitonic properties, including pronounced band modulation, intervalley interlayer exciton transitions, and a tenfold photoluminescence enhancement along with a sevenfold increase in exciton decay time at cryogenic temperatures compared to the heterobilayer system. Temperature-dependent studies reveal intriguing interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterotrilayer, including the emergence of valley-polarized interlayer excitons, and the ability to maintain optical stability up to room temperature.

Thus, the prevailing interpretation of ferroelectric switching dynamics fails under real operating conditions. Here we introduce a compact dynamic-field-driven nucleation and growth (DFNG) model that enables quantitative fits to switching transients across multiple ferroelectric materials to extract time-varying domain wall velocity and growth dimensionality, even under arbitrary voltage waveform. This capability then motivates its use in device modeling under complex signals spanning disparate time and frequency scales. Coupling the compact model to application-related waveforms facilitates a predictive materials-circuit co-design framework by linking nucleation and growth parameters to memory window, disturb error, speed, and energy dissipation for next-generation ferroelectric technologies."}

Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena."}

Furthermore, its applicability is limited to systems with spin-orbit coupling, which motivates the need for alternative measures of chirality. In this work, we explore two complementary measures of chirality: electron chirality and hydrodynamic helicity. By analyzing a minimal atomic model under chiral crystal fields, we clarify how the interplay among crystal fields, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlation gives rise to non-zero values of chirality measures. Although electron chirality increases with both spin-orbit coupling and chiral crystal field strength, the dependence on these two factors is highly non-trivial. Particularly, when the chiral crystal field is varied continuously and the energy levels approach quasidegenerate points, the electron chirality is insensitive to spin-orbit coupling, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of chirality. In contrast, the hydrodynamic helicity, defined as a two-body pseudoscalar quantity, remains non-zero even without spin-orbit coupling, originating from electron-electron interactions. Perturbative analysis reveals distinct symmetry selection rules governing the two quantities. Our results provide fundamental insight into the origin of chiralities in electronic systems."}

Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations. Our findings elucidate the intricate interplay among lattice, orbital, spin, and electronic degrees of freedom and reveal a feasible structural control parameter for the multi-orbital correlated state in trilayer nickelates, which provide a concrete framework for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure."}

Through extensive exploration of the Sr-Li-Al-O and Ba-Y-Al-O systems, we show that uMLIP can rediscover experimentally known materials absent from its training set and identify seven new thermodynamically and dynamically stable compounds.

Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches."}

In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies."}

Elements from the first three rows of the periodic table, together with selected transition and coinage metals, were examined on the pristine surface and at boron- and nitrogen-vacancy sites. On pristine h-BN, adsorption is generally weak and dominated by dispersion forces, with measurable chemisorption limited to highly electronegative atoms such as C, O, and F. The introduction of vacancies transforms h-BN into a chemically active material, increasing adsorption energies by one to two orders of magnitude. The boron vacancy strongly stabilizes metallic and electropositive species through coordination to undercoordinated nitrogen atoms, whereas the nitrogen vacancy selectively binds electronegative and covalent adsorbates. Scaling of adsorption energies with elemental cohesive energies distinguishes regimes of physisorption, chemisorption, and substitutional stabilization. These insights provide a unified description of adsorption trends across the periodic table and establish defect engineering as an effective strategy for tailoring the catalytic, sensing, and electronic properties of h-BN."}

The low-energy parameters are stable and consistent with established values, while $g_{πN}^2/(4π)$ exhibits larger uncertainties. The extraction of $g_{πN}^2/(4π)$ is data-driven, relying on the analytic constraints from the left-hand cut and phase-shift data within the one-pion-exchange approximation.

Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region.

While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in particular, as shot noise in the spin current, which are different from fluctuations in equilibrium, especially at low temperatures. Here, we theoretically study the fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and their signatures in experimental setups. We find that the fluctuations from the injection of spin current play a large role. In the quantum regime, the inverted magnetic state exhibits larger fluctuations compared to the equilibrium position, which can be probed using a qubit. Our results advance the understanding of the fundamental properties of antimagnons and their experimental controllability, and they pave the way for applications in spintronics and magnonics, such as spin wave amplification and entanglement."}

Using the leading charged hadron as a reference axis, the azimuthal plane is divided into Toward and Transverse regions, enabling a robust background subtraction and extending EEC measurements into the low $p_T$ regime where conventional jet-based approaches become unreliable. The method is validated through comparisons with conventional jet reconstruction results. We systematically explore the dependence of the EEC on the leading-particle transverse momentum and parton flavor. The observed scaling between the EEC peak position and the hard scale suggests that this topology-based EEC captures effectively the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes. Distinct differences are found between quark- and gluon-initiated events, reflecting their different color charges and radiation patterns. Extending the analysis to heavy flavor, EECs triggered by leading charm mesons exhibit a suppressed magnitude and a peak shifted toward larger angular separations relative to inclusive charged-particle triggers, providing a direct manifestation of the dead-cone effect. This jet-free EEC framework offers a simple and experimentally robust tool for studying the scale and flavor dependence of the QCD dynamics, with promising applications to proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC."}

Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \\le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals."}

Using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate that a noncollinear ground state can be stabilized in Rh/Co and Pd/Co atomic bilayers on the Re(0001) surface by four spin exchange interactions, although Co -- a material often used in applications -- is a prototypical ferromagnet with strong pairwise exchange interaction. We further show that unconventional skyrmion lattices and isolated skyrmions can emerge on this noncollinear magnetic background.

Its rich structural diversity, arising from multiple polymorphs accessible under different synthesis conditions, has made Ta2O5 a long-standing subject of interest. However, a unified understanding of the thermodynamic stability and phase transitions of its polymorphs across pressure-temperature (P-T) space has remained elusive. Here, using first-principles calculations, we map the thermodynamic landscape of Ta2O5 and establish a comprehensive P-T phase diagram together with a phase-stability hierarchy. We find that Gamma-Ta2O5 and B-Ta2O5 dominate the phase diagram over a broad range of P-T conditions: Gamma-Ta2O5 is stabilized at low pressures, while B-Ta2O5 becomes thermodynamically favored at higher pressures up to ~ 60 GPa, beyond which Y-Ta2O5 emerges as the most stable phase. Crucially, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) are shown to play a significant role in determining relative phase stability, contributing substantially to the Gibbs free energy and altering phase boundaries. A re-entrant phase transition between Gamma and B-Ta2O5 is predicted near ~ 2 GPa, revealing unexpected complexity in the phase behavior of this oxide. More generally, we identify a characteristic temperature (T_0), at which zero-point and thermal phonon contributions to the free energy become comparable, and show that T_0 is approximately one-third of the Debye temperature. This relationship provides a simple, physically transparent criterion for assessing the importance of NQEs in phase stability, with implications extending beyond Ta2O5 to a broad class of complex oxides."}

The same modular parameter fixes the neutrino mass matrix, determines the CP asymmetries driving resonant leptogenesis, and correlates the resulting baryon and dark matter abundances.

Then, using atomistic tight-binding and strain-extended continuum models to study the commensurate structures, we identify configurations that minimize the bandwidth beyond the magic angle. The results reveal a strong dependence of band narrowing and topology on strain type, magnitude, direction and lattice relaxation. Particularly, shear strain produces a stronger distortion than uniaxial strain. Including electron-electron interactions through a self-consistent Hartree potential shows that strain broadens the bare bands while reducing electrostatic renormalization. Strain also drives topological transitions as the narrow and remote bands hybridize, establishing twisted and strained bilayer graphene as a tunable platform for flat-band and topological phenomena."}

Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $μ^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements.

Building on the resonant exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) mechanism in 2H-phase TMDs, we report the first observation of upconversion photoluminescence (UPL) in rhombohedral MoS2 and demonstrate that this many-body process is strongly polytype-dependent. Using low-temperature spectroscopy, we observe anti-Stokes emission with superlinear power dependence. Beyond serving as a layer-number sensor, UPL provides a sensitive probe of stacking order. Trilayer ABA and BAB polytypes, indistinguishable by surface potential measurements and second harmonic generation, exhibit markedly different UPL intensities, and this persists in thicker samples. First-principles calculations attribute this polytype dependence to modulation of the Gamma-point conduction manifold, which controls energy-matching conditions for the annihilation process. Power-dependent spectroscopy further disentangles two distinct annihilation channels originating from different dark exciton valleys, identified through their contrasting intensity scaling and opposite density-induced energy shifts. Crucially, the annihilation process doubles the energy separation of nearly degenerate dark excitons while converting their weak emission into bright signal, providing experimental access to valley-specific responses that are obscured in direct dark-exciton spectroscopy.

We focus on dimension-6 four-fermion operators, identifying all finite counterterms in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme at one loop, and as expected find no obstructions to the Slavnov-Taylor identities that cannot be cured by finite counterterms. This represents one step towards moving to higher order calculations."}

However, its impact on electronic dimensionality and exchange mechanisms remains poorly understood. Using Fe-intercalated TaS$_2$ as a model system, we combine X-ray absorption and resonant inelastic scattering with angle-resolved photoemission and first-principles calculations to reveal that intercalation reshapes the host electronic structure. We identify a spin-polarized intercalant-host hybridized band with pronounced out-of-plane dispersion crossing the Fermi level, providing an itinerant channel for interlayer magnetic exchange. This mechanism explains the breakdown of a purely atomic picture and establishes a direct link between lattice geometry, electronic dispersion, and magnetic order. Our findings demonstrate that intercalant-induced itinerancy enables tunable interlayer coupling in otherwise layered magnets, offering a general microscopic framework for engineering magnetic dimensionality in a broad class of intercalated vdW materials."}

It controls various phenomena, such as magnetization reversal, domain formation, domain-wall motion, spin-wave generation, and spin-wave propagation etc. We investigate the mixed anisotropies in face-centred-cubic Permalloy (fcc-Py) and amorphous Cobalt (a-Co) thin films deposited via rf magnetron sputtering on Si (100) substrate with thicknesses, d = 5-125 nm and t = 5-150 nm, respectively. X-ray diffraction technique, atomic force microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry are employed to study the structural, morphological, and magnetic properties. We adopt a qualitative approach to understand the nature of different anisotropies present in both materials. Mixed anisotropies evolve with film thicknesses for both fcc-Py and a-Co films. The role of growth conditions in the emergence of specific anisotropies is discussed in detail. An alteration of the magnetization easy axis from the conventional in-plane orientation is evidenced due to the collective influence of these mixed anisotropies. Based on the dominance of anisotropy components, their origin, and the direction of magnetization tilt, we categorize our samples as belonging to specific regimes. Introduction of magnetization tilt has been proven to be an extremely innovative way to improve the performance of spintronic devices so far. The one-to-one comparison between a sputter-deposited crystalline and an amorphous magnetic material could be beneficial for building a stronger foundation for that."}

The ability to couple to light promotes two-magnon modes as contenders for ultrafast optical manipulation of the magnetic state, beyond conventional zone-center magnonics. While magnon-magnon interactions are known to critically shape the two-magnon line in spontaneous Raman scattering spectra, their role in coherent time-domain excitations remains unexplored. We report a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the influence of magnon-magnon interactions on coherent two-magnon modes in a cubic antiferromagnet excited via Impulsive Stimulated Raman scattering. We reveal the nontrivial evolution of coherent magnetic dynamics in the time domain and the corresponding spectrum and compare it with the spontaneous Raman scattering spectrum. By extending the spin-correlations based theory for two-magnon modes, we derive a unified description of their spectra in Raman Scattering and Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering and highlight the role of magnon-magnon interactions."}

Existing methods have difficulty accurately characterizing single-emitter spectra and optical heterogeneity on a statistical scale.

Analytical derivations, numerical modeling, and experiments on a solution ensemble of emitters validate the technique. We apply SPICEE to blue-emitting ZnSeTe semiconductor nanocrystals relevant to display applications and find that the low color purity in the ensemble spectrum is primarily caused by a small subpopulation of nanocrystals with a distinct emission mechanism. This work demonstrates that SPICEE is a powerful high-throughput tool for accurately characterizing the single-emitter properties of nanoscale systems."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($|ε_{αβ}|e^{iφ_{αβ}}$) and diagonal parameters ($|ε_{αα}-ε_{ββ}|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO) scenarios. Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in terms of the transition probabilities, which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments. Using these two bipartite entanglement measures, we further explore the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, which describes how rapidly bipartite entanglement evolves during neutrino oscillations. We illustrate our results using the baseline lengths and energies corresponding to ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2K, NO$ν$A, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. In the presence of a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, both with and without NSI effects, we compare the QSL time behavior for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations for NO and IO. The most pronounced discrepancies in the QSL time for bipartite entanglement arise from the off-diagonal NSI parameter $ε_{μτ}$ across both the NO and IO scenarios. We emphasize that among all the experiments considered, NO$ν$A and DUNE exhibit a rapid suppression of bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in the standard oscillation scenario with NO at the end of their baseline lengths for the corresponding best-fit value of CP-violating phase. Our results hint at a possible imprint of new physics in neutrino oscillations."}

In this work, we present a detailed study of this process within the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A comparative analysis is performed using a traditional cut-based approach in the single-lepton channel and a multivariate parametric boosted decision tree method in both single-lepton and dilepton final states. We derive one- and two-parameter limits at 95\\% confidence level on the HEFT couplings $δκ_λ$, $c_2$, $c_{2g}$, and $c_{tg}$. The projected bound on $δκ_λ$ is weaker than current experimental constraints from dedicated Higgs-pair measurement; however, this coupling plays a critical role in shaping the multidimensional allowed parameter space. For the remaining HEFT couplings, where no direct experimental limits currently exist, our results provide the first sensitivity projections in the $t\\bar{t}hh$ channel. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong potential of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ production process to probe extended Higgs and top-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model through the exploitation of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ data at the HL-LHC."}

Signatures of strong correlations- such as the onset of atomic or atomic-ligand multiplets and spin-orbit-entangled exciton have been observed in this material by various two-particle spectroscopies, but not previously in photoemission. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive feature at the valence-band edge that is absent in DFT+$U$ calculations and remains unchanged across the Néel transition. After critically examining and ruling out alternative interpretations, we show that an exact diagonalization of a NiS$_6$ cluster yields low-energy final-state configurations of mixed multiplet $d^7$ and $d^8\\underline{L}$ character, whose energy differences are consistent with the observed additional feature. This implies that ARPES directly accesses local Ni-S multiplet physics in NiPS$_3$, revealing a many-body structure beyond mean-field theory. Our results confirm that NiPS$_3$ is an excellent model platform in which strong correlations, reduced dimensionality, and covalent metal-ligand bonding jointly shape both two- and single-particle spectroscopies, underscoring the need for a genuinely quantum many-body description of two-dimensional quantum materials."}

These materials also undergo structural phase transitions, with phase boundaries separating different phases and the kinetics of the phase boundaries governed by the magnetic field and the mechanical stresses. There is a multiplicity of other materials revealing similar phenomena, e.g. magnetic perovskites. To model the propagation of the phase boundaries in deformable magnetic materials at the continuum scale, three ingredients are required: a set of governing equations for the bulk behaviour with coupled magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom, a dependency of the phase boundary velocity on the governing factors, and a reliable computational method. The expression for the phase boundary velocity is usually obtained within the continuum thermodynamics setting, where the entropy production due to phase boundary propagation is derived, which gives a thermodynamic driving force for the phase boundary kinetics. For deformable ferromagnets, all three elements (bulk behaviour, interface kinetics, and computational approaches) have been explored, but under a number of limitations. The present paper focuses on the derivation of the thermodynamic driving force for transformation fronts in a general magneto-mechanical setting, adapts the cut-finite-element method for transformation fronts in magneto-mechanics, which allows for an exceptionally efficient handling of the propagating interfaces, without modifying the finite-element mesh, and applies the developments to qualitative modelling of magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys."}

Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \\le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals."}
