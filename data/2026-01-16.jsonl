Adopting a quadratic potential, and omitting universe expansion for the moment, we establish initial exponential growth of the low-momentum gauge modes; damping of axion oscillations after some delay; and subsequent energy equipartition between axion and gauge ensembles. A clear difference between the SU(2) and U(1) dynamics is observed, likely associated with non-Abelian self-interactions.

Here, we compute the \\textit{total} diffuse boosted cosmic neutrino background (DBC$ν$B) arising from CRs at all redshifts in the Universe, accounting for neutral current and charged current elastic and deep inelastic scatterings.

This paper takes Meta's Llama 3 8B and applies it to financial NER by combining instruction fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Each annotated sentence is converted into an instruction-input-output triple, enabling the model to learn task descriptions while fine-tuning with small low-rank matrices instead of updating all weights. Using a corpus of 1,693 sentences, our method obtains a micro-F1 score of 0.894 compared with Qwen3-8B, Baichuan2-7B, T5, and BERT-Base.

We identify a previously unrecognized spin-chiral interaction (SCI) arising from the kagome lattice topology, which plays a decisive role in stabilizing the experimentally observed magnetic textures.

The K-matrix is a powerful, yet comparatively simple, method to describe scattering amplitudes, including coupled-channel effects, with the aim to interpret experimental data. Throughout the literature, a range of dispersive and nondispersive K-matrix methods are employed. Here, we compare the dispersive and nondispersive formulations in the context of the N/D method. It is shown that the methods are equivalent in the physical region under K-matrix reparameterization. Differences away from the physical region are examined. Applications to synthetic data are used to illustrate the effects of model choices concerning form factors and the application of dispersion relations, with the goal of clarifying best practices. We find no clear preference with regards to dispersive modeling. In contrast, we find that interpretational ambiguity of the bare model parameters -- and even of the form of the bare model -- is endemic, and recommend a thorough sampling of data and model spaces to assess conclusion robustness."}

Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm."}

We store level-set values, gradients, and Hessians on particles concentrated in a narrow band around the interface, advecting them via bidirectional flow maps while using a conventional grid-based representation elsewhere. By interpreting the level set value as a 3-form and its gradient as a 1-form, PFM-LS achieves exceptional geometric fidelity during complex deformations and preserves sub-grid features that traditional methods cannot capture. Our dual-timescale approach utilizes long-range maps for values and gradients, with frequent reinitialization of short-range maps for the distortion-sensitive Hessian, alongside adaptive particle control that maintains sufficient density within the narrow band. We also develop a hybrid particle-grid quasi-Newton redistancing scheme that preserves fine-scale features while enforcing the signed-distance property. Benchmark comparisons in 2D and 3D demonstrate that PFM-LS achieves state-of-the-art volume preservation and shape fidelity against a broad range of existing level-set methods."}

Yet practical deployment demands ultrathin films down to the atomic limit, where both orders typically degrade. Maintaining both order parameters at the thinnest scales in complex oxides remains a tremendous challenge, as uncompensated bound charge drives nanoscale depolarization in most ferroelectrics, while off-stoichiometry, reduced anisotropy, and charge transfer can produce magnetic dead layers in ultrathin oxides at substrate interfaces. Here, we realize a multiferroic phase of BiFeO3 that not only sustains both order parameters at room temperature with no dead layer but also exhibits signatures of emergent altermagnetism in the four-unit-cell, ultrathin limit. First-principles calculations, spin symmetry analysis, atomic-resolution imaging, and angle-resolved magnetic imaging reveal that short-circuit electrostatic boundary conditions, together with epitaxial strain, drive a continuous second-order, thickness-driven phase transition that enables the formation of multiferroic topological textures. Moreover, the imposed boundary conditions stabilize a d-wave altermagnetic time-reversal symmetry breaking, with corresponding signatures observed in magnetic circular dichroism. Collectively, these results establish a pathway to stabilize unconventional multiferroicity at device-relevant thicknesses, reframing scaling limits for oxide electronics."}

Interestingly, by calculating the efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of this finite momentum pairing state via a Ginzburg-Landau theory, we uncover that a high efficiency can be obtained in these systems for experimentally relevant spin splittings. Therefore, our prediction reveals that the experimental discovery of these new materials represents a promising platform for the construction of energy-efficient logic circuits that can potentially be used, e.g., in the fields of classical and quantum computing."}

In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-André-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{typ}}\\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-André-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge.

We first propose an interfacial treatment for solving an advection-diffusion equation with a Neumann boundary condition, and then extend it to general conjugate scalar transport with both interfacial flux and scalar jumps. A one-dimensional diffusion problem is solved to verify the present scheme and demonstrate the advantage of the present scheme in improving accuracy and unifying the governing equations in the two phases with an additional source term representing the local jump condition of the interfacial scalar flux. Then, the present scheme is further applied to fluid-solid coupled scalar diffusion and advection-diffusion problems with the scalar and its flux jumps across the interface.

In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space."}

Current-voltage characteristics were obtained as a function of Rn by varying the distance between the tip and sample at temperatures of 50 mK and 1.5 K. Rn decreases as the tip-sample separation is reduced, and the junction evolves from a phase-diffusion regime to an underdamped small junction regime, and then to a point contact regime. The subgap structure exhibits pronounced multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) features whose amplitudes and onset energies depend sensitively on junction transparency and gap asymmetry. To interpret these spectra, we generalize the Averin-Bardas MAR theory to superconductors with unequal gap magnitudes, providing a quantitative model appropriate for asymmetric STM junctions. The resulting fits yield the superconducting gaps of the electrodes, barrier transparency, and number of conduction channels as a function of Rn. Combining this analysis with Josephson junction dynamics, we further account for the observed switching and retrapping currents and the finite resistance of the supercurrent branch. Our results demonstrate that incorporating intrinsic electrode asymmetry is essential for reliably extracting transport parameters in STM-based superconducting weak links."}

We explore the behaviors of specific bulk viscosity ($ζ/s$) and $ζ/η$ across different QCD phase transitions, including the Mott phase transition, the chiral crossover, and the first-order transition with the associated metastable phase. The calculation shows that both $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ are extremely small at high temperatures, approaching the nature of a conformal theory. Larger $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ are derived near the chiral phase transition at finite temperature. Along the chiral crossover line, $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$ generally increase with decreasing temperature, though $ζ/η$ exhibits a slight decline near the critical endpoint (CEP). On the boundary of the first-order transition, $ζ/s$ shows a non-monotonic variation with temperature. Furthermore, an additional peak structure emerges beyond the chiral phase boundary for both $ζ/s$ and $ζ/η$, with magnitudes even exceeding those near the chiral crossover of $u, d$ quarks. Our analysis indicates this peak originates from the chiral crossover transformation of strange quark."}

The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices."}

Ru3 was deposited by both solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition of Ru3(CO)12, while Pt3 was deposited under ultra-high vacuum using a laser vaporisation cluster source. The valence electronic density of states (DOS) of the deposited clusters were analysed after heat treatment using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES), where UPS measures the top several layers while MIES measures only the top atomic layer. XPS was used to determine the cluster surface coverages. The DOS were found to be very similar between Ru3 deposited by solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition. MIES results for Ru3 had contributions from titania O 2p sites due to encapsulation by a reduced titania overlayer. For Pt3 clusters the UPS and MIES results provided evidence that Pt was present on the topmost layer, and encapsulation did not occur. The proposed reason for the encapsulation of Ru3 but not of Pt3 is the higher surface energy of Ru over Pt. It is concluded that Pt clusters deposited onto TiO2 can modify the outermost layer by adding discrete energy levels on the surface, whereas the Ru clusters being encapsulated just below the surface generate a broad distribution of energy states close to the Fermi level. The outcome of this work is that Pt3-cluster-modified surfaces could be used as catalysts for reactions where the Pt3 energy levels are suitable for the respective reaction. The implication of the DOS found for photocatalytic water splitting are discussed."}

For conventional Nb3Sn conductors this requires reduction of effective subelement size (Deff). For the restacked-rod-process (RRP) conductors a physical subelement size (Dsub) as small as 35 um (corresponding to a Deff close to 45 um) can be reached, but at a significant price in Jc. Another way to reduce the magnetization is by introducing artificial pinning centers (APC) using the internal oxidation approach. APC conductors outperform conventional Nb3Sn wires in two aspects: 1) higher Jc at high fields, and 2) much lower Jc and magnetization at low fields (e.g., below 5 T). In this work we explored the fabricability of APC wires with small Dsub. A 180-stack APC wire was produced and drawn to 0.7- and 0.5-mm diameters with good quality, with Dsubs of 34 and 24 um (Deffs of 36 and 25 um), respectively. For the 34-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc is higher than that of an RRP wire used for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project above 13 T (e.g., 36% higher at 4.2 K, 18 T), while its non-Cu magnetization at 1 T, ΔM(1 T), is only 29% of the RRP wire. Its non-Cu hysteresis loss for a cycle between 1 and 14 T, Qh(1-14 T), is 37% of the RRP wire. For the 24-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc surpasses the HL-LHC RRP wire above 17.5 T, while its ΔM(1 T) and Qh(1-14 T) are only 17% and 23% of the RRP wire, respectively. Its non-Cu Qh(+/-3 T) even meets the specification of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project."}

However, numerical simulations of relativistic spin hydrodynamics remain largely unaddressed due to computational challenges, particularly the accurate numerical conservation of total angular momentum. In this work, we propose the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics. As a concrete application, we consider a rotating fluid confined within a cylindrical container. We show that angular-momentum conservation can be accurately achieved in the PINNs-based numerical framework. Furthermore, we investigate the spin-orbit conversion induced by the rotational viscous effect, which is the intrinsic dissipative process of relativistic spin hydrodynamics. Our analysis numerically identifies the mismatch between the transverse thermal vorticity and the spin potential as the driving mechanism of the spin-orbit conversion."}

The multiphase superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ appears to be a notable exception from this trend. Showing clear signatures of magnetism, this tetragonal system is suspected to host a concomitant quadrupolar order, which could be causing the strong enhancement of the ordering temperature when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the fourfold ($c$) axis of the lattice. In this work, we show that the field-temperature phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has a remarkable basal-plane anisotropy. This finding supports the scenario of coupled magnetic and multipolar ordering, which may have implications for the pairing mechanism of the superconductivity, and guides the development of the next iteration of theoretical models."}

Our saddle point searches reveal that high-symmetry transformations from cuboctahedra and Ino's decahedra to icosahedra proceed through a single barrier and represent soft-mode-driven jitterbug-type and slip-dislocation motions. In addition, we identify lower-barrier asymmetric transformation pathways that drive the system into disordered, Jahn-Teller-stabilized amorphous icosahedra. Minima Hopping sampling further uncovers, in this context, many such low-symmetry minima. Some of the newly identified global minima for Au309 and Au561 have energies that are up to 2.8 eV lower than the previously reported global minima. Hence, both the shapes and the transformation pathways studied in previous investigations are not the physically relevant ones. In contrast to the previously studied pathways, our transformation pathways give reasonable transformation times that are in rough agreement with experiments."}

We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions.

Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter."}

In the minimal Type-I seesaw scenario with two nearly degenerate HNLs, the heavy--light neutrino mixings are strongly correlated with the light-neutrino mass spectrum, leading to distinct flavor patterns for the normal and inverted hierarchies. We demonstrate that future $Z$ factories, such as CEPC and FCC-ee, can probe the neutrino mass ordering for total HNL mixings as small as $U_{\\rm tot}^2 \\gtrsim 4 \\times 10^{-9}$, and discriminate between the two hierarchies for $U_{\\rm tot}^2 \\gtrsim 10^{-6}$.

Yet its molecular-level mechanism from water adsorption to Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth remains elusive due to its complex and multi-step nature. Here, we elucidate the molecular process of MgO hydration based on structures of the MgO/water interface obtained by a combined computational chemistry approach of potential-scaling molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations without any a priori assumptions about reaction pathways. The result shows that the Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution follows the dissociative water adsorption. We find that this initial dissolution can proceed exothermically even from the defect-free surface with an average activation barrier of $\\sim$12 kcal/mol. This exothermicity depends crucially on the stabilization of the resulting surface vacancy, achieved by proton adsorption onto neighboring surface oxygen atoms. Further Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution then occurs in correlation with proton penetration into the solid. Moreover, we find that the Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth proceeds according to the dissolution-precipitation mechanism, rather than a solid-state reaction mechanism involving a direct topotactic transformation. In this process, Mg$^{2+}$ ions migrate away from the surface and form amorphous Mg-OH chains as precursors for Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation. We also demonstrate that sufficient water facilitates the formation of more ordered crystalline nuclei. This computational study provides a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of MgO hydration, representing a foundational step toward elucidating the mechanisms of this class of complex and multi-step solid-surface chemical reactions."}

We evaluate how an integrated Cu heatsink modifies the superconducting response of TaN nanowires by improving thermal dissipation without significantly compromising key superconducting parameters. Through analysis of hysteresis in current-voltage curves, we demonstrate that Cu integration improves heat dissipation, supporting expectations of faster reset times in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs), consistent with enhanced heat transfer away from the hot spot. Using the Skocpol-Beasley-Tinkham (SBT) hotspot model, we quantify the Cu-enabled improvement in heat transfer as an approximately 100x increase in the SBT slope parameter beta and effective interfacial heat-transfer efficiency compared to TaN nanowires. The near-unity ratio of critical to retrapping current in TaN/Cu bilayer nanowires provides another evidence of efficient heat removal enabled by the integrated Cu layer. Our results show a zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 7 nm and a critical temperature of 4.1 K for 39 nm thick TaN nanowires. The nanowires show <5% variation in critical dimensions, room-temperature resistance, residual resistance ratio, critical temperature, and critical current across the 300 mm wafer for all measured linewidths, demonstrating excellent process uniformity and scalability.

Radiative corrections can induce controlled departures from locality in the latticed space, thereby generating suppressed but non-vanishing masses for the remaining $N_f-1$ generations. In this work, we present an explicit implementation of this mechanism to address the flavour hierarchies of the Standard Model. After delineating the minimal extensions of the gauge, scalar, and Yukawa sectors required for feasible implementation of the mechanism, we demonstrate that the framework successfully reproduces the observed charged-fermion mass spectrum and quark mixing pattern. We analyse the new-physics effects arising from the extended sectors and confront them with existing constraints from direct, indirect searches and precision measurements. It is shown that a viable realisation of the mechanism allows the spectrum of vectorlike fermions and additional gauge boson to lie at scales as low as $\\mathcal{O}(5)\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ with the lightest states typically corresponding to top partners. This stands in sharp contrast to conventional radiative mass-generation scenarios, in which phenomenological constraints typically impose a lower bound on the new-physics scale of order a few hundred to several thousand TeV."}

Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field.

With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states\" with vanishing total Chern number.

A widely used material is TiSi$_2$, which combines low electronic resistivity with good endurance. However, its multitude of polymorphs continues to pose a challenge for device fabrication. In particular, the naturally occurring formation of the metastable C49-TiSi$_2$ modification remains poorly understood and is problematic due to its unfavorable electronic properties. Based on extensive DFT calculations, we present a comprehensive model of Ti adsorption on Si(100) that highlights the pivotal role of surface topology for the initial stages of the interfacial TiSi$_2$ formation process. We show that the interplay between Si surface dimers, the symmetry of the Si(100) surface, and the incorporation of Ti adsorbates below the surface drives an adsorption pattern that yields a nucleation template for the C49-TiSi$_2$ phase. Our atomistic model rationalizes experimental observations like the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode, the preferential formation of C49-TiSi$_2$ despite it being less favorable than the competing C54 phase, and why disruption of the surface structure restores thermodynamically driven growth of the latter. Ultimately, this novel perspective on the unique growth of TiSi$_2$ will help to pave the way for next-generation electronic devices."}

Current-voltage characteristics were obtained as a function of Rn by varying the distance between the tip and sample at temperatures of 50 mK and 1.5 K. Rn decreases as the tip-sample separation is reduced, and the junction evolves from a phase-diffusion regime to an underdamped small junction regime, and then to a point contact regime. The subgap structure exhibits pronounced multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) features whose amplitudes and onset energies depend sensitively on junction transparency and gap asymmetry. To interpret these spectra, we generalize the Averin-Bardas MAR theory to superconductors with unequal gap magnitudes, providing a quantitative model appropriate for asymmetric STM junctions. The resulting fits yield the superconducting gaps of the electrodes, barrier transparency, and number of conduction channels as a function of Rn. Combining this analysis with Josephson junction dynamics, we further account for the observed switching and retrapping currents and the finite resistance of the supercurrent branch. Our results demonstrate that incorporating intrinsic electrode asymmetry is essential for reliably extracting transport parameters in STM-based superconducting weak links."}

Using a high-accuracy machine learned potential trained on some 20'000 density functional theory reference data points, we investigate transformation pathways connecting both high-symmetry and amorphous cuboctahedra, Ino's decahedra and icosahedra for Au55, Au147, Au309 and Au561 nanoclusters. Our saddle point searches reveal that high-symmetry transformations from cuboctahedra and Ino's decahedra to icosahedra proceed through a single barrier and represent soft-mode-driven jitterbug-type and slip-dislocation motions. In addition, we identify lower-barrier asymmetric transformation pathways that drive the system into disordered, Jahn-Teller-stabilized amorphous icosahedra. Minima Hopping sampling further uncovers, in this context, many such low-symmetry minima. Some of the newly identified global minima for Au309 and Au561 have energies that are up to 2.8 eV lower than the previously reported global minima. Hence, both the shapes and the transformation pathways studied in previous investigations are not the physically relevant ones. In contrast to the previously studied pathways, our transformation pathways give reasonable transformation times that are in rough agreement with experiments."}

Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm."}

Interestingly, by calculating the efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of this finite momentum pairing state via a Ginzburg-Landau theory, we uncover that a high efficiency can be obtained in these systems for experimentally relevant spin splittings. Therefore, our prediction reveals that the experimental discovery of these new materials represents a promising platform for the construction of energy-efficient logic circuits that can potentially be used, e.g., in the fields of classical and quantum computing."}

Ru3 was deposited by both solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition of Ru3(CO)12, while Pt3 was deposited under ultra-high vacuum using a laser vaporisation cluster source. The valence electronic density of states (DOS) of the deposited clusters were analysed after heat treatment using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES), where UPS measures the top several layers while MIES measures only the top atomic layer. XPS was used to determine the cluster surface coverages. The DOS were found to be very similar between Ru3 deposited by solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition. MIES results for Ru3 had contributions from titania O 2p sites due to encapsulation by a reduced titania overlayer. For Pt3 clusters the UPS and MIES results provided evidence that Pt was present on the topmost layer, and encapsulation did not occur. The proposed reason for the encapsulation of Ru3 but not of Pt3 is the higher surface energy of Ru over Pt. It is concluded that Pt clusters deposited onto TiO2 can modify the outermost layer by adding discrete energy levels on the surface, whereas the Ru clusters being encapsulated just below the surface generate a broad distribution of energy states close to the Fermi level. The outcome of this work is that Pt3-cluster-modified surfaces could be used as catalysts for reactions where the Pt3 energy levels are suitable for the respective reaction. The implication of the DOS found for photocatalytic water splitting are discussed."}

This correspondence is established by matching massless amplitudes to Minimal Helicity-Chirality (MHC) amplitudes, which arise from an expansion of massive spin-spinor amplitudes in terms of the chirality-flip $mη$ order by order. The primary MHC amplitude deforms into a massless amplitude of the same helicity; if a vector boson is involved, it may instead vanish due to the associated conserved current. In cases where the primary amplitude vanishes, the leading contributions originate from descendant MHC amplitudes, each corresponding to a distinct massless amplitude in the ultraviolet theory containing either a transverse gauge boson or a Goldstone boson. We propose a systematic amplitude deformation procedure for three-point massless-massive matching based on helicity-chirality unification and the scaling properties of $mη$. Sub-leading MHC amplitudes are matched to massless amplitudes with additional on-shell Higgs splitting, a process known as on-shell Higgsing. In this work, we extend and reinterpret on-shell Higgsing as a transversality flip between different MHC states, and obtain all the 3-point massless-massive matching results in the spontaneous broken standard model."}

Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states\" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential.

Starting from the one-loop resummed gluon propagator in the imaginary-time formalism, and incorporating non-perturbative effects through a phenomenological correction to the HTL description, we compute the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity. This, in turn, leads to a complex heavy-quark potential: the real part is used to determine binding energies by solving the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation, while the imaginary part generates thermal decay widths, dominated by Landau damping. Within the explored parameter range, temperature has the greatest control over Debye screening, potential modification, and quarkonium stability, whereas finite density and weak magnetic fields introduce comparatively smaller quantitative changes. As the temperature increases, binding energies decrease and thermal widths grow, giving rise to the expected hierarchy between ground and excited states and a sequential suppression pattern in the dissociation temperatures. Overall, our results indicate that while finite chemical potential and weak magnetic fields can shift quarkonium properties in a measurable way, thermal effects remain the primary driver of dissociation, with direct relevance for heavy-ion collision phenomenology."}

Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field.

The Kerr and Faraday rotation angles exhibit the resonant enhancement with sign reversals in the microwave regime as a function of the light frequency, reaching peak values on the order of 100 nrad--10 $μ$rad in thin films of candidate chiral superconductors. These resonances are accessible in superconducting atomic layer materials and provide a generic probe of chiral superconductivity in two-dimensional systems."}

After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves."}

Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials."}

However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons."}

Here, we resolve this by introducing the \"wavefunction form factor\" (WFF) matrix, a quantity directly constructible from intensities in momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopies like ARPES and INS. We demonstrate that band topology is encoded in \"spectral nodes\" -- momentum-space points where the WFF determinant vanishes, providing a direct readout of topological invariants via a topological selection rule. Furthermore, when the number of independent probes exceeds the number of the target bands, our framework yields an effective band projector. This enables the determination of Wilson loop spectra and the extraction of an effective quantum geometric tensor, providing a model-independent measurement of the non-Abelian Berry curvature and quantum metric as resolved by the experimental probes."}
